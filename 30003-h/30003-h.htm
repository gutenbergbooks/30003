<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The scope of this volume is indicated by its title&mdash;a
presentation of the lighter side of law, as it is exhibited
from time to time in the witty remarks, repartees,
and <i>bon mots</i> of the Bench and Bar of Great Britain,
Ireland, and America. The idea of presenting such a
collection of legal <i>faceti&aelig;</i> originated with the late Mr.
D. Macleod Malloch, and it is greatly to be regretted
that by his untimely death, his share of the work had
reached the stage of selecting only about one-half of
the material included in the book. His knowledge of
law, and his wide reading in legal biography, was such
as would have increased considerably the value of this
volume.</p>

<p>In addition to sources which are acknowledged in the
text, I have to mention contributions drawn from the
following works: W. D. Adams' <i>Modern Anecdotes</i>;
W. Andrews' <i>The Lawyer in History, Literature and
Humour</i>; Croake James's <i>Curiosities of Law</i>; F. R.
O'Flanagan's <i>The Irish Bar</i>; and A. Engelbach's comprehensive
and entertaining <i>Anecdotes of the Bench
and Bar</i>. I am further indebted to Sir James Balfour
Paul, Lyon King of Arms, for permission to include
"The Circuiteer's Lament," from the privately printed
volume <i>Ballads of the Bench and Bar</i>, and to the editor
of the <i>Edinburgh Evening Dispatch</i> for a number
of the more recent anecdotes in the Scottish chapters
of the book.</p>

<h2>LAW AND LAUGHTER<br />
BY GEORGE A. MORTON<br />
AND D. MACLEOD MALLOCH<br /><br /></h2>

<h2>CHAPTER ONE<br />
THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND</h2>


<p>Mr. Justice Darling, whose witty remarks
from the Bench are so much appreciated by his
audiences in Court, and, it is rumoured, are not always
received with approval by his brother judges, says, in
his amusing book <i>Scintill&aelig; Juris</i>:</p>

<p>"It is a common error to suppose that our law has
no sense of humour, because for the most part the
judges who expound it have none."</p>

<p>But law is, after all, a serious business&mdash;at any rate
for the litigants&mdash;and it would appear also for the attorneys,
for while witticisms of the Bench and Bar abound,
very few are recorded of the attorney and his
client. "Law is law" wrote the satirist who decided
not to adopt it as a profession. "Law is like a country
dance; people are led up and down in it till they are
tired. Law is like a book of surgery&mdash;there are a great
many terrible cases in it. It is also like physic&mdash;they
who take least of it are best off. Law is like a homely
gentlewoman&mdash;very well to follow. Law is like a
scolding wife&mdash;very bad when it follows us. Law is
like a new fashion&mdash;people are bewitched to get into
it. It is also like bad weather&mdash;most people are glad
when they get out of it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>From very early times there have appeared on the
Bench expounders of the law who by the phrase "for
the most part" must be acquitted of Mr. Justice Darling's
charge of having no sense of humour; judges
who, like himself, have lightened the otherwise dreary
routine of duty by pleasantries which in no way interfered
with the course of justice. One of the earliest of
our witty judges, whose brilliant sayings have come
down to us, was Henry VIII's Lord Chancellor, Sir
Thomas More, who lost his head because he would not
acknowledge his king as head of the Church. To Sir
Thomas Manners, Earl of Rutland, who had made a
somewhat insolent remark, the Lord Chancellor quietly
replied, 'Honores mutant mores'&mdash;Honours change
manners. Sir Thomas's humour was what may be
called <i>quiet</i>, because its effect did not immediately show
itself in boisterous merriment, but would undoubtedly
remain long in the remembrance of those to whom it
was addressed. Made with as much courtesy as irony,
is it likely his keeper in the Tower would ever forget
his remark? "Assure yourself I do not dislike my
cheer; but whenever I do, then spare not to thrust me
out of your doors." Nor did his quaint humour desert
him at the scaffold: "Master Lieutenant," said he, "I pray
you see me safe up; for my coming down let me shift for
myself." Even with his head on the block he could
not resist a humorous remark, when putting aside his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>beard he said to the executioner, "Wait, my good
friend, till I have removed my beard, for it has never
offended his highness."</p>

<p>Another judge of the sixteenth century, Sir Nicholas
Bacon, who resembled Sir Thomas More in the
gentleness of his happiest speeches, could also on occasion
exhibit an unnecessary coarseness in his jocular
retorts. A circuit story is told of him in which a
convicted felon named Hog appealed for remission of
his sentence on the ground that he was related to his
lordship. "Nay, my friend," replied the judge, "you
and I cannot be kindred except you be hanged, for hog
is not bacon until it be well hung." This retort was
not quite so coarse as that attributed to the Scottish
judge, Lord Kames, two centuries later, who on sentencing
to death a man with whom he had often played
chess and very frequently been beaten, added after the
solemn words of doom, "And noo, Matthew, ye'll admit
that's checkmate for you."</p>

<p>To Lord Chancellor Hatton, also an Elizabethan
judge who aimed at sprightliness on the Bench, a clever
<i>mot</i> is attributed. The case before him was one concerning
the limits of certain land. The counsel having
remarked with emphasis, 'We lie on this side, my lord,'
and the opposing counsel with equal vehemence having
interposed, 'And we lie on this side, my lord'&mdash;the
Lord Chancellor dryly observed, "If you lie on both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>sides, whom am I to believe?" It would seem that
punning was as great a power in the Law Courts of
that time as it is at the present day. When Egerton as
Master of the Rolls was asked to commit a cause&mdash;refer
it to a Master in Chancery&mdash;he would reply, "What
has the cause done that it should be committed?"</p>

<p>Many witticisms of Westminster Hall, attributed to
barristers of the Georgian and Victorian periods, are
traceable to a much earlier date. There is the story of
Serjeant Wilkins, whose excuse for drinking a pot of
stout at mid-day was, that he wanted to fuddle his brain
down to the intellectual standard of a British jury.
Two hundred and fifty years earlier, Sir John Millicent,
a Cambridgeshire judge, on being asked how he
got on with his brother judges replied, "Why, i' faithe,
I have no way but to drink myself down to the capacity
of the Bench." And this merry thought has also been
attributed to one eminent barrister who became Lord
Chancellor, and to more than one Scottish advocate
who ultimately attained to a seat on the Bench.</p>

<p>And to various celebrities of the later Georgian
period has been attributed Lord Shaftesbury's reply
to Charles II. When the king exclaimed, "Shaftesbury,
you are the most profligate man in my dominions,"
the Chancellor answered somewhat recklessly,
"Of a subject, sir, I believe I am."</p>

<p>Bullying witnesses is an old practice of the Bar, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>for instances of it emanating from the Bench one has
to go very far back. A witness with a long beard was
giving evidence that was displeasing to Jeffreys, when
judge, who said: "If your conscience is as large as your
beard, you'll swear anything." The old man retorted:
"My lord, if your lordship measures consciences by
beards, your lordship has none at all."</p>

<p>A somewhat similar story of Jeffreys' bullying manner,
when at the Bar, is that of his cross-examining a
witness in a leathern doublet, who had made out a
complete case against his client. Jeffreys shouted:
"You fellow in the leathern doublet, pray what have
you for swearing?" The man looked steadily at him,
and "Truly, sir," said he, "if you have no more for lying
than I have for swearing, you might wear a leathern
doublet as well as I."</p>

<p>Instances of disrespect to the Bench are rarely met
with in early as happily in later days. There is, perhaps,
the most flagrant example of young Wedderburn
in the Scottish Court of Session, when with dramatic
effect he threw off his gown and declared he would
never enter the Court again; but he rose to be Lord
Chancellor of England. Scarcely less disrespectful
(but not said openly to the Bench) was young Edward
Hyde when hinting that the death of judges was of
small moment compared with his chances of preferment.
"Our best news," he wrote to a friend, "is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>we have good wine abundantly come over; our worst
that the plague is in town, <i>and no judges die</i>."</p>

<span class="caption">ALEXANDER WEDDERBURN, EARL OF ROSSLYN, LORD CHANCELLOR.</span>
</div>

<p>In squabbles between the Bench and the Bar there
are few stories that match for personality the retort of
a counsel to Lord Fortescue. His lordship was disfigured
by a purple nose of abnormal growth. Interrupting
counsel one day with the observation: "Brother,
brother, you are handling the case in a very lame manner,"
the angry counsel calmly retorted, "Pardon me,
my lord; have patience with me and I will do my best
to make the case as plain as&mdash;as&mdash;the nose on your
lordship's face." Nor did the retort of an Attorney-General
to a judge, after a warm discussion on a point
which the latter claimed to decide, show much respect
for the Bench. The judge closed the argument with
"I ruled so and so."&mdash;"<i>You</i> ruled," muttered the Attorney-General.
"<i>You</i> ruled! You were never fit to
rule anything but a copy-book."</p>

<p>Verse has been used as a medium of much amusing
legal wit and humour, although law and law cases do
not offer very easy subjects for turning into rhyme.
But a good illustration is afforded by Mr. Justice
Powis, who had a habit of repeating the phrase, "Look,
do you see," and "I humbly conceive." At York Assize

</div>

<p>Many of the well-known witticisms attributed to
great judges are so tinged with personality&mdash;even
tending to malignity&mdash;that no one possessing respect
for human nature can read them without being tempted
to regard them as mere biographical fabrications.
But such a construction cannot be put upon the stories
told of Lord Chancellor Thurlow, whose overbearing
insolence to the Bar is well known. To a few friends
like John Scott, Lord Eldon, and Lloyd Kenyon, Lord
Kenyon, he could be consistently indulgent; but to
those who provoked him by an independent and fearless
manner he was little short of a persecutor. Once
when Scott was about to follow his leader, who had
made an unusually able speech, the Chancellor addressed
him: "Mr. Scott, I am glad to find you are en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>gaged
in the cause, for I now stand some chance of
knowing something about the matter." This same
leader of the Bar on one occasion, in the excitement of
professional altercation, made use of an undignified
expression before Lord Thurlow; but before his lordship
could take notice of it the counsel immediately
apologised, saying, "My lord, I beg your lordship's
pardon. I really forgot for the moment where I was."
A silent recognition of the apology would have made
the counsel feel his position more keenly, but the
Chancellor could not let such an opportunity pass and
immediately flashed out: "You thought you were in
your own Court, I presume," alluding to a Welsh
judgeship held by the offending counsel.</p>

<p>As a contrast to Lord Thurlow's treatment of Scott's
leader, the following story&mdash;given in Scott's own
words&mdash;shows how the great Chancellor could unbend
himself in the company of men who were in his favour.
"After dinner, one day when nobody was present but
Lord Kenyon and myself, Lord Thurlow said, 'Taffy,
I decided a cause this morning, and I saw from Scott's
face that he doubted whether I was right.' Thurlow
then stated his view of the case, and Kenyon instantly
said, 'Your decision was quite right.' 'What say you
to that?' asked the Chancellor. I said, 'I did not presume
to form a case on which they were both agreed.
But I think a fact has not been mentioned, which may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>be material.' I was about to state the fact, and my
reasons. Kenyon, however, broke in upon me, and
with some warmth stated that I was always so obstinate
there was no dealing with me. 'Nay,' interposed
Thurlow, 'that's not fair. You, Taffy, are obstinate,
and give no reasons. You, Jack, are obstinate too; but
then you give your reasons, and d&mdash;d bad ones they
are!'"</p>

<p>Another anecdote again illustrates the Chancellor's
treatment of even those who were on a friendly footing
with him. Sir Thomas Davenport, a great Nisi
Prius leader, had long flattered himself with the hope
of succeeding to some valuable appointment in the law;
but several good things passing by, he lost his patience
and temper along with them. At last he addressed
this laconic application to his patron: "The Chief
Justiceship of Chester is vacant; am I to have it?" and
received the following laconic answer: "No! by G&mdash;d!
Kenyon shall have it."</p>

<p>Scarcely less courteous was this Lord Chancellor's
treatment of a solicitor who endeavoured to prove to
him a certain person's death. To all his statements the
Chancellor replied, "Sir, that is no proof," till at last
the solicitor losing patience exclaimed: "Really, my
lord, it is very hard and it is not right that you should
not believe me. I knew the man well: I saw the man
dead in his coffin. My lord, the man was my client."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>"Good G&mdash;d, sir! why didn't you tell me that sooner?
I should not have doubted the fact one moment; for I
think nothing can be so likely to kill a man as to have
you for his attorney."</p>

<p>As Keeper of the Great Seal Thurlow had the
alternate presentation to a living with the Bishop
of &mdash;&mdash;. The Bishop's secretary called upon the
Lord Chancellor and said, "My Lord Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;
sends his compliments to your lordship, and believes
that the next turn to present to &mdash;&mdash; belongs to his
lordship."&mdash;"Give his lordship my compliments," replied
the Chancellor, "and tell him that I will see him
d&mdash;d first before he shall present."&mdash;"This, my lord,"
retorted the secretary, "is a very unpleasant message
to deliver to a bishop." To which the Chancellor replied,
"You are right, it is so; therefore tell the Bishop
that <i>I will be</i> d&mdash;d first before he shall present."</p>

<p>Lord Campbell in his life of Thurlow says that in
his youth the Chancellor was credited with wild excesses.
There was a story, believed at the time, of
some early amour with the daughter of a Dean of Canterbury,
to which the Duchess of Kingston alluded
when on her trial at the House of Lords. Looking Thurlow,
then Attorney-General, full in the face she said,
"That learned gentleman dwelt much on my faults, but
I too, if I chose, could tell a Canterbury tale."</p>

<p>But with all his bitterness and sarcasm Lord Thur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>low
had a genuine sense of humour, as the following
story of his Cambridge days illustrates&mdash;days when
he was credited with more disorderly pranks and impudent
escapades than attention to study. "Sir," observed
a tutor, "I never come to the window but I
see you idling in the Court."&mdash;"Sir," replied the future
Lord Chancellor, "I never come into the Court but I
see you idling at the window."</p>

<span class="caption">WILLIAM MURRAY, EARL OF MANSFIELD, LORD CHIEF JUSTICE.</span>
</div>

<p>Mansfield was not credited with lively sensibility,
but his humanity was shocked at the thought of killing
a man for a trifling theft. Trying a prisoner at the Old
Baily on the charge of stealing in a dwelling-house to
the value of 40<i>s.</i>&mdash;when this was a capital offence&mdash;he
advised the jury to find a gold trinket, the subject of
the indictment, to be of less value. The prosecutor exclaimed
with indignation, "Under 40<i>s.</i>, my lord! Why,
the <i>fashion</i> alone cost me more than double the sum."&mdash;"God
forbid, gentlemen, we should hang a man for
fashion's sake," observed Lord Mansfield to the jury.</p>

<p>An indictment was tried before him at the Assizes,
preferred by parish officers for keeping an hospital for
lying-in women, whereby the parish was burdened by
illegitimate children. He expressed doubts whether
this was an indictable offence, and after hearing arguments
in support of it he thus gave his judgment. "We
sit here under a Commission requiring us to <i>deliver</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>this gaol, and the statute has been cited to make it unlawful
to <i>deliver</i> a woman who is with child. Let the
indictment be quashed."</p>

<p>Having met at supper the famous Dr. Brocklesby,
he entered into familiar conversation with him, and
there was an interchange of stories just a little trenching
on the decorous. It so happened that the doctor
had to appear next morning before Lord Mansfield in
the witness-box; and on the strength of the previous
evening's doings the witness, on taking up his position,
nodded to the Chief Justice with offensive familiarity
as to a boon companion. His lordship taking no notice
of his salutation, but writing down his evidence, when
he came to summing it up to the jury thus proceeded:
"The next witness is one Rocklesby or Brocklesby,
Brocklesby or Rocklesby&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;and
first he swears he is a physician."</p>

<p>Lord Chief Baron Parker, in his eighty-seventh
year, having observed to Lord Mansfield who was seventy-eight:
"Your lordship and myself are now at sevens
and eights," the younger Chief Justice replied: "Would
you have us to be all our lives at sixes and sevens?
But let us talk of young ladies and not old age."</p>

<p>Trying an action which arose from the collision of
two ships at sea, a sailor who gave an account of the
accident said, "At the time I was standing abaft the
binnacle."&mdash;"Where is abaft the binnacle?" asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>Lord Mansfield; upon which the witness, who had
taken a large share of grog before coming into Court,
exclaimed loud enough to be heard by all present: "A
pretty fellow to be a judge, who don't know where
abaft the binnacle is!" Lord Mansfield, instead of
threatening to commit him for contempt, said: "Well,
my friend, fit me for my office by telling me where
<i>abaft the binnacle is</i>; you have already shown me the
meaning of <i>half-seas over</i>."</p>

<p>On one occasion Lord Mansfield covered his retreat
from an untenable position with a sparkling pleasantry.
An old witness named ELM having given his evidence
with remarkable clearness, although he was
more than eighty years of age, Lord Mansfield examined
him as to his habitual mode of living, and found
he had been through life an early riser and a singularly
temperate man. "Ay," remarked the Chief Justice, in
a tone of approval, "I have always found that without
temperance and early habits longevity is never attained."
The next witness, the elder brother of this
model of temperance, was then called, and he almost
surpassed his brother as an intelligent and clear-headed
utterer of evidence. "I suppose," observed
Lord Mansfield, "that you are an early riser?"&mdash;"No,
my lord," answered the veteran stoutly; "I like my
bed at all hours, and special-<i>lie</i> I like it of a morning."&mdash;"Ah,
but like your brother, you are a very temper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>ate
man?" quickly asked the judge, looking out anxiously
for the safety of the more important part of his
theory. "My lord," responded this ancient Elm, disdaining
to plead guilty to a charge of habitual sobriety,
"I am a very old man, and my memory is as clear as a
bell, but I can't remember the night when I've gone to
bed without being more or less drunk."&mdash;"Ah, my
lord," Mr. Dunning exclaimed, "this old man's case
supports a theory unheld by many persons&mdash;that
habitual intemperance is favourable to longevity."&mdash;"No,
no," replied the Chief Justice with a smile; "this
old man and his brother merely teach us what every
carpenter knows&mdash;that Elm, whether it be wet or dry,
is a very tough wood."</p>

<span class="caption">JOHN SCOTT, EARL OF ELDON, LORD CHANCELLOR.</span>
</div>

<p>Lord Eldon's good humour gained him the affection
of all counsel who practised before him, but there is
one story&mdash;apocryphal it may be, coming from Lord
Campbell&mdash;of a prejudice he had against Lord Brougham,
who, in Scottish cases, frequently appeared before
him in the House of Lords. Lord Eldon persisted in
addressing the advocate as Mr. Bruffam. This was too
much for Brougham, who was rather proud of the form
and antiquity of his name, and who at last, in exasperation,
sent a note to the Chancellor, intimating that his
name was pronounced "Broom." At the conclusion of
the argument the Chancellor stated, "Every authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>upon the question has been brought before us: new
Brooms sweep clean."</p>

<p>As Lord Chancellor, Lord Eldon's great foible was
an apparent inability to arrive at an early decision on
any question: it was really a desire to weigh carefully
all sides of a question before expressing his opinion.
This hesitancy was expressed in the formula "I doubt,"
which became the subject of frequent jests among the
members of the Bar.</p>

<p>Sir George Rose, in absence of the regular reporter
of Lord Eldon's decisions, was requested to take a note
of any decision which should be given. As a full record
of all that was material, which had occurred during the
day, Sir George made the following entry in the reporter's
notebook:</p>

<div class="poetryblock">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mr. Leach made a speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Angry, neat, but wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mr. Hart, on the other part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was heavy, dull, and long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mr. Parker made the case darker,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was dark enough without;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mr. Cooke cited his book;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Chancellor said&mdash;I doubt."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This <i>jeu d'esprit</i>, flying about Westminster Hall,
reached the Chancellor, who was very much amused
with it, notwithstanding the allusion to his doubting
propensity. Soon after, Sir George Rose having to
argue before him a very untenable proposition, he gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>his opinion very gravely, and with infinite grace and
felicity thus concluded: "For these reasons the judgment
must be against your clients; and here, Sir
George, the Chancellor does not <i>doubt</i>."</p>

<p>The following was Lord Eldon's answer to an application
for a piece of preferment from his old friend Dr.
Fisher, of the Charter House:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Fisher</span>,&mdash;I cannot, to-day, give you the
preferment for which you ask.&mdash;I remain, your sincere
friend, <span class="smcap">Eldon</span>." Then, on the other side, "I gave it
to you yesterday."</p>

<p>According to his biographer, Lord Eldon caused a
loud laugh while the old Duke of Norfolk was fast
asleep in the House of Lords, and amusing their lordships
with "that tuneful nightingale, his nose," by announcing
from the woolsack, with solemn emphasis,
that the Commons had sent up a bill for "enclosing
and dividing Great Snoring in the county of Norfolk!"</p>

<p>Like Lord Thurlow, Lord Eldon was in close intimacy
with George III in the days when his Majesty's
mind was supposed to be not very strong. "I took
down to Kew," relates his lordship, "some Bills for his
assent, and I placed on a paper the titles and the effect
of them. The king, being perhaps suspicious that my
coming down might be to judge of his competence for
public business, as I was reading over the titles of the
different Acts of Parliament he interrupted me and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>said: 'You are not acting correctly, you should do one
of two things; either bring me down the Acts for my
perusal, or say, as Thurlow once said to me on a like
occasion, having read several he stopped and said, "It
is all d&mdash;d nonsense trying to make you understand
them, and you had better consent to them at once."'"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It is not often, but it sometimes happens that a judge
finds himself in conflict with members of the public
who are under no restraint of professional privilege or
etiquette. Some maintain the dignity of the Court by
fining and committing for contempt. Occasionally this
may be necessary, but it has been found that delicate
ridicule is often more effective. An attorney, pleading
his cause before Lord Ellenborough, became exasperated
because the untenable points he continually
raised were invariably overruled, and exclaimed, "My
lord, my lord, although your lordship is so great a man
now, I remember the time when I could have got your
opinion for five shillings." With an amused smile his
lordship quietly observed, "Sir, I say it was not worth
the money."</p>

<p>The same judge used to be greatly annoyed during
the season of colds with the noise of coughing in Court.
On one occasion, when disturbances of this kind recurred
with more than usual frequency, he was seen
fidgeting about in his seat, and availing himself of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
slight cessation observed in his usual emphatic manner:
"Some slight interruption one <i>might</i> tolerate, but
there seems to be an <i>industry</i> of coughing."</p>

<p>As an illustration of figurative oratory a good story
is told of a barrister pleading before Lord Ellenborough:
"My lord, I appear before you in the character
of an advocate for the City of London; my lord, the
City of London herself appears before you as a suppliant
for justice. My lord, it is written in the book of
nature."&mdash;"What book?" said Lord Ellenborough.
"The book of nature."&mdash;"Name the page," said his lordship,
holding his pen uplifted, as if to note the page
down.</p>

<p>Moore relates the story of a noble lord in the course
of one of his speeches saying, "I ask myself so and so,"
and repeating the words "I ask myself." "Yes," quietly
remarked Lord Ellenborough, "and a d&mdash;d foolish answer
you'll get."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The comparison of a father and son who have both
ascended the Bench has afforded a good story of a famous
Scottish advocate which is told later, and the following
is an equally cutting retort from the Bench to
any assumed superiority through such a connection. A
son of Lord Chief Justice Willes (who rose to the rank
of a Puisne Judge) was checked one day for wandering
from the subject. "I wish that you would remember,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>he exclaimed, "that I am the son of a Chief Justice."
To which Justice Gould replied with great simplicity,
"Oh, we remember your father, but he was a sensible
man."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When hanging was the sentence, on conviction, for
crimes&mdash;in these days termed offences&mdash;which are now
punished by imprisonment, some judges from meting
out the sentence of death almost indiscriminately came
to be known as "hanging judges." Justice Page was one
of them. When he was decrepit he perpetrated a joke
against himself. Coming out of the Court one day and
shuffling along the street a friend stopped him to inquire
after his health. "My dear sir," the judge replied,
"you see I keep just hanging on&mdash;hanging on."</p>

<p>A Chief Justice of the "hanging" period, whose integrity
was not above suspicion, was sitting in Court
one day at his ease and lolling on his elbow, when a
convict from the dock hurled a stone at him which fortunately
passed over his head. "You see," said the
learned man as he smilingly received the congratulations
of those present&mdash;"you see now, if I had been
an <i>upright judge</i> I had been slain."</p>

<p>Some of the stories respecting Lord Kenyon's historical
allusions and quotations are surely greatly exaggerated,
or are pure inventions. In addressing a jury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>in a blasphemy case, he is reported to have said that
the Emperor Julian "was so celebrated for the practice
of every Christian virtue that he was called 'Julian the
Apostle'"; and to have concluded an elaborate address
in dismissing a grand jury with the following valediction:
"Having thus discharged your consciences, gentlemen,
you may return to your homes in peace, with
the delightful consciousness of having performed your
duties well, and may lay your heads on your pillows,
saying to yourselves 'Aut C&aelig;sar, aut nullus.'" And
this was his remark on detecting the trick of an attorney
to delay a trial: "This is the last hair in the
tail of procrastination, and it must be plucked
out."</p>

<p>Among other failings attributed to this Lord Chief
Justice was the extreme penuriousness he practised in
his domestic arrangements and his dress. His shoes
were patched to such an extent that little of their original
material could be seen, and once when trying a
case he was sitting on the bench in a way to expose
them to all in Court. It was an action for breach of contract
to deliver shoes soundly made, and to clinch a
witness for the pursuer he suddenly asked, "Were the
shoes anything like these?" pointing to his own. "No,
my lord," replied the witness, "they were a good deal
better and more genteeler."</p>

<p>As an example of his (Lord Kenyon's) style of ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>dressing
a condemned prisoner we have the following.
A butler had been charged and convicted of stealing
his master's wine.</p>

<p>"Prisoner at the bar, you stand convicted on the
most conclusive evidence of a crime of inexpressible
atrocity&mdash;a crime that defiles the sacred springs of
domestic confidence, and is calculated to strike alarm
into the breast of every Englishman who invests largely
in the choicer vintages of Southern Europe. Like
the serpent of old, you have stung the hand of your
protector. Fortunate in having a generous employer,
you might without discovery have continued to supply
your wretched wife and children with the comforts of
sufficient prosperity, and even with some of the luxuries
of affluence; but, dead to every claim of natural
affection, and blind to your own real interest, you
burst through all the restraints of religion and morality,
and have for many years been <i>feathering</i> your nest
with your master's <i>bottles</i>."</p>

<p>Lord Kenyon was warmly attached to George III,
who had a high opinion of him; but like many of his
lordship's contemporaries, his Majesty strongly deprecated
the frequent outbursts of temper on the part
of his Chief Justice. "At a levee, soon after an extraordinary
explosion of ill-humour in the Court of King's
Bench, his Majesty said to him: 'My Lord Chief Justice,
I hear that you have lost your temper, and from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>my great regard for you, I am very glad to hear it, for
I hope you will find a better one.'"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Of Lord Chief Justice Tenterden, Lord Campbell
asserts that he once, and only once, uttered a pun. A
learned gentleman, who had lectured on the law and
was too much addicted to oratory came to argue a
special demurrer before him. "My client's opponent,"
said the figurative advocate, "worked like a mole under
ground, <i>clam et secret&egrave;</i>." His figures only elicited
a grunt from the Chief Justice. "It is asserted in Aristotle's
<i>Rhetoric</i>&mdash;."&mdash;"I don't want to hear what is asserted
in Aristotle's <i>Rhetoric</i>," interposed Lord Tenterden.
The advocate shifted his ground and took up,
as he thought, a safe position. "It is laid down in the
<i>Pandects</i> of Justinian&mdash;." "Where are you got now?"
"It is a principle of the civil law&mdash;." "Oh sir," exclaimed
the judge, with a tone and voice which abundantly
justified his assertion, "we have nothing to do
with the <i>civil</i> law in this Court."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Judges sometimes stray into humour without intending
it. At an election petition trial one allegation
was, that a number of rosettes, or "marks of
distinction," had been kept in a table drawer in the
central committee-room. To meet this charge it was
thought desirable to call witnesses to swear that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>only table in the room consisted of planks laid on
trestles. "So that the table had no proper legs," said
counsel cheerfully. "Never mind whether it had proper
legs," said one of the learned judges. "The more
important question is: Had it drawers?"</p>

<p>And in <i>The Story of Crime</i> the author recalls an instance
of a judge unconsciously furnishing material
for laughter in Court. "At the beginning of the session
at the Old Baily a good deal of work is got through
by the judge who takes the small cases, and it may be
this fact that accounted for the confusion of thought
which he describes. One of the prisoners was charged
with stealing a camera, and after all the evidence had
been taken his lordship proceeded to sum up to the
jury. He began by correctly describing the stolen article
as a camera, but had not gone very far before the
camera had become a concertina, and by the time he
had finished the concertina had become an accordion.
And he never once saw his mistake. The usher noticed
it at the first trip, and kept repeating in a kind of
hoarse stage-whisper, 'Camera! Camera!' but his
voice did not reach the Bench, and so the complicated
article remained on record."</p>

<p>Mr. Andrews in his book, <i>The Lawyer in History,
Literature, and Humour</i>, relates that a leader of the
Bar on rising to address the drowsy jury after a ponderous
oration by Sir Samuel Prime, said: "Gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>men,
after the long speech of the learned serjeant&mdash;"
"Sir, I beg your pardon," interrupted Mr. Justice
Nares, "you might say&mdash;you might say&mdash;after the long
soliloquy, for my brother Prime has been talking an
hour to himself."</p>

<p>Thomas, Lord Erskine was the youngest of three
brothers, who were all distinguished men. The eldest
was the well-known Earl of Buchan, one of the founders
of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, whose
eccentricities formed the subject of much gossip in the
Scottish capital. To an English nobleman he declared:
"My brothers Harry and Tom are certainly remarkable
men, but they owe everything to me." Seeing a
look of surprise upon his friend's face he added: "Yes,
it is true; they owe everything to me. On my father's
death they pressed me for an annual allowance. I
knew this would have been their ruin, by relaxing their
industry. So making a sacrifice of my inclinations to
gratify them I refused to give them a farthing, and they
have thriven ever since&mdash;<i>owing everything to me</i>."</p>

<p>Henry, the second brother, was universally beloved
and respected, and one of the most popular advocates
at the Scottish Bar. He was twice Lord-Advocate for
Scotland&mdash;on the second occasion under the Ministry
of "All the Talents," when his younger brother was
Lord Chancellor. He was famous in the Parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>House and outside of it for his witticisms, a selection
of which will be given later.</p>

<p>Thomas, who became Lord Chancellor, obtained an
unique influence while practising at the Bar, and, like
his older brother, he was a universal favourite. "Juries
have declared," said Lord Brougham, "that they have
felt it impossible to remove their looks from him when
he had riveted, and as it were fascinated, them by his
first glance. Then hear his voice, of surpassing sweetness,
clear, flexible, strong, exquisitely fitted to strains
of serious earnestness." Yet although he did not rely
on wit, or humour, or sarcasm in addressing a jury,
he could use them to effect in cross-examination. "You
were born and bred in Manchester, I perceive," he said
to a witness. "Yes."&mdash;"I knew it," said Erskine carelessly,
"from the absurd tie of your neckcloth." The
witness' presence of mind was gone, and he was made
to unsay the greatest part of his evidence in chief.
Another witness confounding 'thick' whalebone with
'long' whalebone, and unable to distinguish the difference
after counsel's explanation, Erskine exclaimed,
"Why, man, you do not seem to know the difference
between what is <i>thick</i> or what is <i>long</i>! Now I
tell you the difference. You are <i>thick</i>-headed, and you
are not <i>long</i>-headed."</p>

<p>Lord Erskine's addiction to punning is well known,
and many examples might be cited. An action was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>brought against a stable-keeper for not taking proper
care of a horse. "The horse," said counsel for the
plaintiff, "was turned into the stable, with nothing to
eat but musty hay. To such the horse 'demurred.'"&mdash;"He
should have 'gone to the country,'" at once retorted
Lord Erskine. For the general reader it should
be explained that "demurring" and "going to the
country" are technical terms for requiring a cause to
be decided on a question of law by the judge, or on a
question of fact by the jury. Here is another. A low-class
attorney who was much employed in bail-business
and moving attachments against the sheriff for
not "bringing in the body"&mdash;that is, not arresting and
imprisoning a debtor, when such was the law&mdash;sold
his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields to the Corporation,
of Surgeons to be used as their Hall. "I suppose it
was recommended to them," said Erskine, "from the
attorney being so well acquainted 'with the practice of
bringing in the body!'"</p>

<p>Perhaps one of his smartest puns he relates himself.
"A case being laid before me by my veteran friend,
the Duke of Queensberry&mdash;better known as 'old Q'&mdash;as
to whether he could sue a tradesman for breach of
contract about the painting of his house; and the evidence
being totally insufficient to support the case, I
wrote thus: 'I am of opinion that this action will not lie
unless the witnesses do.'"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<p>He was also fond of a practical joke. In answer to a
circular letter from Sir John Sinclair, proposing that a
testimonial should be presented to himself for his
eminent public services, Lord Erskine replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir John</span>,&mdash;I am certain there are few
in this kingdom who set a higher value on your public
services than myself; and I have the honour to subscribe"&mdash;then,
on turning over the leaf, was to be
found&mdash;"myself, your most obedient faithful servant,</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Erskine</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury," were his closing words
after an impassioned address, "the reputation of a
cheesemonger in the City of London is like the bloom
upon a peach. Breathe upon it, and it is gone for
ever."</p>

<p>Among many apocryphal stories told of expedients
by which smart counsel have gained verdicts, this one
respecting a case in which Mr. Justice Gould was the
judge and Erskine counsel for the defendant is least
likely of credit. The judge entertained a most unfavourable
opinion of the defendant's case, but being very
old was scarcely audible, and certainly unintelligible,
to the jury. While he was summing up the case, Erskine,
sitting on the King's Counsel Bench, and full in
the view of the jury, nodded assent to the various re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>marks
which fell from the judge; and the jury, imagining
that they had been directed to find for the defendant,
immediately did so.</p>

<p>When at the Bar, Erskine was always encouraged
by the appreciation of his brother barristers. On one
occasion, when making an unusual exertion on behalf
of a client, he turned to Mr. Garrow, who was his colleague,
and not perceiving any sign of approbation on
his countenance, he whispered to him, "Who do you
think can get on with that d&mdash;d wet blanket face of
yours before him."</p>

<p>Nor did he always exhibit graciousness to older
members. One nervous old barrister named Lamb,
who usually prefaced his pleadings with an apology,
said to Erskine one day that he felt more timid as he
grew older. "No wonder," replied Erskine, "the older
the lamb the more sheepish he grows."</p>

<p>When he was Lord Chancellor he was invited to attend
the ministerial fish dinner at Greenwich&mdash;known
in later years as the Whitebait Dinner&mdash;he replied:
"To be sure I will attend. What would your fish dinner
be without the Great Seal?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When a stupid jury returns an obviously wrong verdict
the judge must feel himself in an awkward position;
but in such cases&mdash;if they ever occur now&mdash;a good
precedent has been set by Mr. Justice Maule who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>when in that predicament, addressed the prisoner in
these terms:</p>

<p>"Prisoner, your counsel thinks you innocent, the
prosecution thinks you innocent, and I think you innocent.
But a jury of your own fellow-countrymen, in
the exercise of such common sense as they possess,
have found you guilty, and it remains that I should pass
sentence upon you. You will be imprisoned for one day,
and as that day was yesterday, you are free to go about
your business."</p>

<p>"May God strike me dead! my lord, if I did it," excitedly
exclaimed a prisoner who had been tried before
the same justice for a serious offence, and a verdict of
"guilty" returned by the jury. The judge looked grave,
and paused an unusually long time before saying a
word. At last, amid breathless silence, he began: "As
Providence has not seen fit to interpose in your case, it
now becomes my duty to pronounce upon you the sentence
of the law," &amp;c. When somewhat excited over a
very bad case tried before him he would delay sentence
until he felt calmer, lest his impulse or his temper
should lead him astray. On one such occasion he exclaimed,
"I can't pass sentence now. I might be too
severe. I feel as if I could give the man five-and-twenty
years' penal servitude. Bring him up to-morrow when
I feel calmer."&mdash;"Thank you, my lord," said the prisoner,
"I know you will think better of it in the morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>ing."
Next day the man appeared in the dock for
sentence. "Prisoner," said the judge, "I was angry
yesterday, but I am calm to-day. I have spent a night
thinking of your awful deeds, and I find on inquiry
I can sentence you to penal servitude for life. I
therefore pass upon you that sentence. I have
thought better of what I was inclined to do yesterday."</p>

<p>There are instances of brief summing up of a case
by judges, but few in the terms expressed by this worthy
judge. "If you believe the witnesses for the plaintiff,
you will find for the defendant; if you believe the
witnesses for the defendant, you will find for the plaintiff.
If, like myself, you don't believe any of them,
Heaven knows which way you will find. Consider your
verdict."</p>

<p>To Mr. Justice Maule a witness said: "You may believe
me or not, but I have stated not a word that is
false, for I have been wedded to truth from my infancy."&mdash;"Yes,
sir," said the judge dryly; "but the question is,
<i>how long have you been a widower?</i>"</p>

<p>In the good old days a learned counsel of ferocious
mien and loud voice, practising before him, received a
fine rebuke from the justice. No reply could be got
from an elderly lady in the box, and the counsel appealed
to the judge. "I really cannot answer," said
the trembling lady. "Why not, ma'am?" asked the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>judge. "Because, my lord, he frightens me so."&mdash;"So
he does me, ma'am," replied the judge.</p>

<p>He was as a rule patient and forbearing, and seldom
interfered with counsel in their mode of laying cases
before a jury or the Bench, but once he was fairly provoked
to do so, by the confused blundering way in
which one of them was trying to instil a notion of what
he meant into the minds of the jury. "I am sorry to
interfere, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," said the judge, "but do you not
think that, by introducing a little order into your narrative,
you might possibly render yourself a trifle more
intelligible? It may be my fault that I cannot follow you&mdash;I
know that my brain is getting old and dilapidated;
but I should like to stipulate for some sort of order.
There are plenty of them. There is the chronological,
the botanical, the metaphysical, the geographical&mdash;even
the alphabetical order would be better than no
order at all."</p>

<p>Baron Thomson, of the Court of Exchequer, was
asked how he got on in his Court with the business,
when he sat between Chief Baron Macdonald and
Baron Graham. He replied, "What between snuff-box
on one side, and chatterbox on the other, we get on
pretty well!"</p>

<p>Sir Richard Bethel, Lord Westbury, and Lord
Campbell were on very friendly terms. An amusing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>story is told of a meeting of the two in Westminster
Hall, when the first rumour of Lord Campbell's appointment
as Lord Chancellor was current. The day
being cold for the time of the year, Lord Campbell had
gone down to the House of Lords in a fur coat, and
Bethel, observing this, pretended not to recognise him.
Thereupon Campbell came up to him and said: "Mr.
Attorney, don't you know me?"&mdash;"I beg your pardon,
my lord," was the reply. "I mistook you for the <i>Great
Seal</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>Lord Cranworth, Vice-Chancellor, after hearing Sir
Richard Bethel's argument in an appeal, said he
"would turn the matter over in his mind." Sir Richard
turning to his junior with his usual bland calm utterance
said: "Take a note of that; his honour says he
will turn it over in what he is pleased to call his mind."</p>

<p>Sir James Scarlett, Lord Abinger, had to examine
a witness whose evidence would be somewhat dangerous
unless he was thrown off his guard and "rattled."
The witness in question&mdash;an influential man, whose
vulnerable point was said to be his self-esteem&mdash;was
ushered into the box, a portly overdressed person,
beaming with self-assurance. Looking him over for a
few minutes without saying a word Sir James opened
fire: "Mr. Tompkins, I believe?"&mdash;"Yes."&mdash;"You are a
stockbroker, I believe, are you not?"&mdash;"I ham." Pausing
for a few seconds and making an attentive survey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>of him, Sir James remarked sententiously, "And a very
fine and well-dressed ham you are, sir."</p>

<p>In a breach of promise case Scarlett appeared for
the defendant, who was supposed to have been cajoled
into the engagement by the plaintiff's mother, a titled
lady. The mother, as a witness, completely baffled the
defendant's clever counsel when under his cross-examination;
but by one of his happiest strokes of advocacy,
Scarlett turned his failure into success. "You
saw, gentlemen of the jury, that I was but a child in
her hands. <i>What must my client have been?</i>"</p>

<p>Sir James was a noted cross-examiner and verdict-getter,
but on one occasion he was beaten. Tom Cooke,
a well-known actor and musician in his day, was a witness
in a case in which Sir James had him under cross-examination.</p>

<p>Scarlett: "Sir, you say that the two melodies are
the same, but different; now what do you mean by that,
sir?"</p>

<p>Cooke: "I said that the notes in the two copies are
alike, but with a different accent."</p>

<p>Scarlett: "What is a musical accent?"</p>

<p>Cooke: "My terms are nine guineas a quarter, sir."</p>

<p>Scarlett (ruffled): "Never mind your terms here. I
ask you what is a musical accent? Can you see it?"</p>

<p>Cooke: "No."</p>

<p>Scarlett: "Can you feel it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p><p>Cooke: "A musician can."</p>

<p>Scarlett (angrily): "Now, sir, don't beat about the
bush, but explain to his lordship and the jury, who are
expected to know nothing about music, the meaning
of what you call accent."</p>

<p>Cooke: "Accent in music is a certain stress laid
upon a particular note, in the same manner as you
would lay stress upon a given word, for the purpose
of being better understood. For instance, if I were to
say, 'You are an <i>ass</i>,' it rests on ass, but if I were to
say, '<i>You</i> are an ass,' it rests on you, Sir James." The
judge, with as much gravity as he could assume, then
asked the crestfallen counsel, "Are you satisfied, Sir
James."&mdash;"The witness may go down," was the counsel's
reply.</p>

<p>Lord Justice Holt, when a young man, was very dissipated,
and belonged to a club, most of whose members
took an infamous course of life. When his lordship
was engaged at the Old Baily a man was convicted
of highway robbery, whom the judge remembered to
have been one of his early companions. Moved by curiosity,
Holt, thinking the man did not recognise him,
asked what had become of his old associates. The
culprit making a low bow, and giving a deep sigh, replied,
"Oh, my lord, they are all hanged but your lordship
and I."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>We have already given examples of personalities in
the retorts of counsel upon members of the Bench,
and if the same derogatory reflection can be traced in
the two following anecdotes of judges' retorts on counsel,
it is at least veiled in finer sarcasm. A nervous
young barrister was conducting a first case before
Vice-Chancellor Bacon, and on rising to make his
opening remarks began in a faint voice: "My lord, I
must apologise&mdash;er&mdash;I must apologise, my lord"&mdash;"Go
on, sir," said his lordship blandly; "so far the
Court is with you." The other comes from an Australian
Court. Counsel was addressing Chief Justice
Holroyd when a portion of the plaster of the Court
ceiling fell, and he stopping his speech for the moment,
incautiously advanced the suggestion, "Dry rot has
probably been the cause of that, my lord."&mdash;"I am
quite of your opinion, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," observed his lordship.</p>

<p>On the other hand, judges can be severely personal
at times, and Lord Justice Chitty was almost brutal in
a case where counsel had been arguing to distraction
on a bill of sale. "I will now proceed to address myself
to the furniture&mdash;an item covered by the bill," counsel
continued. "You have been doing nothing else for the
last hour," lamented the weary judge.</p>

<p>And Mr. Justice Wills once made a rather cutting
remark to a barrister. The barrister was, in the judge's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>private opinion, simply wasting the time of the Court,
and, in the course of a long-winded speech, he dwelt
at quite unnecessary length on the appearance of certain
bags connected with the case. "They might," he
went on pompously, "they might have been full bags,
or they might have been half-filled bags, or they might
even have been empty bags, or&mdash;."&mdash;"Or perhaps,"
dryly interpolated the judge, "they might have been
wind-bags!"</p>

<p>When Lord Brougham attained the position of Lord
Chancellor he was greatly addicted to the habit of
writing during the course of counsel's argument of the
case being heard before him. On one occasion this
practice so annoyed Sir Edward Sugden, whenever he
noticed it, that he paused in the course of his argument,
expecting his lordship to stop writing; but the Chancellor,
without even looking up, remarked, "Go on, Sir
Edward; I am listening to you."&mdash;"I observe that your
lordship is engaged in writing, and not favouring me
with your attention," replied Sir Edward. "I am signing
papers of mere form," warmly retorted the Chancellor.
"You may as well say that I am not to blow my
nose or take snuff while you speak."</p>

<p>When counsel at the Bar, a witness named John
Labron was thus cross-examined by Brougham at
York Assizes:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>"What are you?"</p>

<p>"I am a farmer, and malt a little."</p>

<p>"Do you know Dick Strother?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Upon your oath, sir, are you not generally known
by the name of Dick Strother?"</p>

<p>"That has nothing to do with this business."</p>

<p>"I insist upon hearing an answer. Have you not obtained
that name?"</p>

<p>"I am sometimes called so."</p>

<p>"Now, Dick, as you admit you are so called, do you
know the story of the hare and the ball of wax?"</p>

<p>"I have heard it."</p>

<p>"Then pray have the goodness to relate it to the
judge and the jury."</p>

<p>"I do not exactly remember it."</p>

<p>"Then I will refresh your memory by relating it myself.
Dick Strother was a cobbler, and being in want of
a hare for a friend, he put in his pocket a ball of wax
and took a walk into the fields, where he soon espied
one. Dick then very dexterously threw the ball of wax
at her head, where it stuck, which so alarmed poor puss
that in the violence of her haste she ran in contact with
the head of another; both stuck fast together, and Dick,
lucky Dick! caught both. Dick obtained great celebrity
by telling this wondrous feat, which he always affirmed
as a truth, and from that every notorious liar in Thor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>ner
bears the title of Dick Strother. Now, Dick&mdash;I
mean John&mdash;is not that the reason why you are called
Dick Strother?"</p>

<p>"It may be so."</p>

<p>"Then you may go."</p>

<p>The same turbulent spirit (Lord Brougham) fell
foul of many other law lords. It is well known that in
a speech made at the Temple he accused Lord Campbell,
who had just published his <i>Lives of the Chancellors</i>,
of adding a new terror to death. Lord Campbell
tells an amusing story which shows that he could retort
with effect upon his noble and learned friend. He
says that he called one morning upon Brougham at his
house in Grafton Street, who "soon rushed in very
eagerly, but suddenly stopped short, exclaiming, 'Lord
bless me, is it you? They told me it was Stanley'; and
notwithstanding his accustomed frank and courteous
manner, I had some difficulty in fixing his attention.
In the evening I stepped across the House to the Opposition
Bench, where Brougham and Stanley were
sitting next each other, and, addressing the latter in
the hearing of the former, I said, 'Has our noble and
learned friend told you the disappointment he suffered
this morning? He thought he had a visit from the
Leader of the Protectionists to offer him the Great
Seal, and it turned out to be only Campbell come to
bore him about a point of Scotch law.' <i>Brougham</i>:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>'Don't mind what Jack Campbell says; he has a prescriptive
privilege to tell lies of all Chancellors, dead
and living.'"</p>

<p>According to the same authority, Brougham was at
one time very anxious to be made an earl, but his desire
was entirely quenched when Lord John Russell
gave an earldom to Lord Chancellor Cottenham. He
is said to have been so indignant that he either wrote
or dictated a pamphlet in which the new creation was
ridiculed, and to which was appended the significant
motto, "The offence is rank."</p>

<p>The common feeling with regard to Sir James Scarlett's
(Lord Abinger) success in gaining verdicts led to
the composition of the following pleasantry, attributed
to Lord Campbell. "Whereas Scarlett had contrived
a machine, by using which, while he argued, he could
make the judges' heads nod with pleasure, Brougham
in course of time got hold of it; but not knowing how
to manage it when he argued, the judges, instead of
nodding, shook their heads."</p>

<p>And it is Lord Campbell who has preserved the following
specimen of a judge's concluding remarks to a
prisoner convicted of uttering a forged one-pound note.
After having pointed out to him the enormity of the
offence, and exhorted him to prepare for another world,
added: "And I trust that through the merits and the
mediation of our Blessed Redeemer, you may there ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>perience
that mercy which a due regard to the <i>credit of
the paper currency</i> of the country forbids you to hope
for here."</p>

<p>Campbell married Miss Scarlett, a daughter of Lord
Abinger, and was absent from Court when a case in
which he was to appear was called before Mr. Justice
Abbot. "I thought, Mr. Brougham," said his lordship,
"that Mr. Campbell was in this case?"&mdash;"Yes, my lord,"
replied Mr. Brougham, with that sarcastic look peculiarly
his own. "He was, my lord, but I understand he is
ill."&mdash;"I am sorry to hear that, Mr. Brougham," said the
judge. "My lord," replied Mr. Brougham, "it is whispered
here that the cause of my learned friend's absence
is scarlet fever."</p>

<p>In his native town of Cupar, Fife, Lord Chancellor
Campbell's abilities and position were not so much appreciated
as they were elsewhere. This was a sore
point with his father, who was parish minister, and
when the son was not selected by the town authorities
to conduct their legal business in London the
future Lord Chancellor also felt affronted. On the
publication of the <i>Lives of the Chancellors</i> some of his
townsmen wrote asking him to present a copy to the
local library of his native town, which gave Campbell
an opportunity to square accounts with them for their
past neglect of him, for he curtly replied to their re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>quest
that "they could purchase the book from any
bookseller." An old lady of the town relating some
gossip about the Campbell family said, "They meant
John for the Church, but he went to London <i>and got
on very well</i>." Such was the good lady's idea of the
relative positions of minister of a Scottish parish and
Lord Chancellor of England.</p>

<p>The difference in the pronunciation of a word led
to an amiable contest between Lord Campbell and a
learned Q.C. In an action to recover damages to a carriage
the counsel called the vehicle a "brougham," pronouncing
both syllables of the word. Lord Campbell
pompously observed, "Broom is the usual pronunciation&mdash;a
carriage of the kind you mean is not incorrectly
called a 'Broom'&mdash;that pronunciation is open to
no grave objection, and it has the advantage of saving
the time consumed by uttering an extra syllable."
Later in the trial Lord Campbell alluding to a similar
case referred to the carriage which had been injured
as an "Omnibus."&mdash;"Pardon me, my lord," interposed
the Q.C., "a carriage of the kind to which you draw
attention is usually termed a 'bus'; that pronunciation
is open to no grave objection, and it has the great
advantage of saving the time consumed by uttering
<i>two</i> extra syllables."</p>

<p>Mr. Martin (afterwards Baron Martin), when at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>Bar, was addressing the Court in an insurance case,
when he was interrupted by Baron Alderson, who said,
"Mr. Martin, do you think any office would insure your
life?"&mdash;"Certainly, my lord," replied Mr. Martin, "mine
is a very good life."&mdash;"You should remember, Mr. Martin,
that yours is brief existence."</p>

<p>This judge's reason for releasing a juryman from
duty was equally smart. The juryman in question
confessed that he was deaf in one ear. "Then leave
the box before the trial begins," observed his lordship;
"it is necessary that the jurymen should hear <i>both</i>
sides."</p>

<p>Baron Martin was one of the good-natured judges
who from the following story seem to stretch that amiable
quality to its fullest extent. In sentencing a man
convicted of a petty theft he said: "Look, I hardly know
what to do with you, but you can take six months."&mdash;"I
can't take that, my lord," said the prisoner; "it's too
much. I can't take it; your lordship sees I did not steal
very much after all." The Baron indulged in one of his
characteristic chuckling laughs, and said: "Well that's
vera true; ye didn't steal <i>much</i>. Well then, ye can tak'
<i>four</i>. Will that do&mdash;four months?"&mdash;"No, my lord, but
I can't take that neither."&mdash;"Then take <i>three</i>."&mdash;"That's
nearer the mark, my lord," replied the prisoner,
"but I'd rather you'd make it <i>two</i>, if you'll be so kind."&mdash;"Very
well then, tak' two," said the judge; "and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>don't come again. If you do, I'll give you&mdash;well, it'll all
depend."</p>

<p>Lord Erskine's punning upon legal terms has already
been noticed, but no better quip is recorded than
that of Lord Chelmsford, when as Sir Frederick Thesiger,
and a leader at the Bar, he took exception to the
irregular examination of a witness by a learned serjeant.
"I have a right," maintained the serjeant, "to
deal with my witness as I please."&mdash;"To that I offer no
objection," retorted Sir Frederick. "You may <i>deal</i> as
you like, but you shan't <i>lead</i>."</p>

<p>On all occasions Samuel Warren, the author of <i>Ten
Thousand a Year</i>, was given to boasting, at the Bar
mess, of his intimacy with members of the peerage.
One day he was saying that, while dining lately at the
Duke of Leeds, he was surprised at finding no fish of
any kind was served. "That is easily accounted for,"
said Thesiger; "they had probably eaten it all <i>upstairs</i>."</p>

<p>Walking down St. James's Street one day, Lord
Chelmsford was accosted by a stranger, who exclaimed,
"Mr. Birch, I believe."&mdash;"If you believe that, sir,
you'll believe anything," replied his lordship as he
passed on.</p>

<span class="caption">SIR ALEXANDER COCKBURN, BART., LORD CHIEF JUSTICE.</span>
</div>

<p>In the recently published <i>Cockburn Family Records</i>
the following is told of the Chief Justice's ready wit:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p>"At a certain trial an extremely pretty girl was called
as a witness. The Lord Chief Justice was very particular
about her giving her full name and address. Of
course he took note. So did the sheriff's officer! That
evening they both arrived at the young lady's door
simultaneously, whereupon Sir Alexander tapped the
officer on the shoulder, remarking, 'No, no, no, Mr. Sheriff's
Officer, judgment first, execution afterwards!"</p>

<p>There never was a barrister whose rise at the Bar
was more rapid or remarkable than that of Sir Alexander
Cockburn, and along with him was his friend
and close associate as a brother lawyer of the Crown
and Bencher of the same Inn, Sir Richard Bethel, who
became Lord Chancellor a few years after Sir Alexander
was made Chief Justice. Sir Richard once said to
his colleague, "My dear fellow, equity will swallow up
your common law."&mdash;"I don't know about that," said
Sir Alexander, "but you'll find it rather hard of digestion."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Although the wit of Lord Justice Knight Bruce was
somewhat sarcastic it was rarely so severe as that of
Lord Westbury. There was always a tone of good
humour about it. He had indeed a kind of grave judicial
waggery, which is well exemplified in the following
judgment in a separation suit between an attorney and
his wife. "The Court has been now for several days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>occupied in the matrimonial quarrels of a solicitor and
his wife. He was a man not unaccustomed to the ways
of the softer sex, for he already had nine children by
three successive wives. She, however&mdash;herself a widow&mdash;was
well informed of these antecedents; and it appears
did not consider them any objection to their
union; and they were married. No sooner were they
united, however, than they were unhappily disunited
by unhappy disputes as to her property. These disputes
disturbed even the period usually dedicated to
the softer delights of matrimony, and the honeymoon
was occupied by endeavours to induce her to exercise
a testamentary power of appointment in his favour.
She, however, refused, and so we find that in due
course, at the end of the month, he brought home with
some disgust his still intestate bride. The disputes
continued, until at last they exchanged the irregular
quarrels of domestic strife for the more disciplined
warfare of Lincoln's Inn and Doctors Commons."</p>

<p>Of this judge the story is told that a Chancery counsel
in a long and dry argument quoted the legal maxim&mdash;<i>expressio
unius est exclusio alterius</i>&mdash;pronouncing
the "i" in <i>unius</i> as short as possible. This roused his
lordship from the drowsiness into which he had been
lulled. "Unyus! Mr. &mdash;&mdash;? We always pronounced
that <i>unius</i> at school."&mdash;"Oh yes, my lord," replied the
counsel; "but some of the poets use it short for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>sake of the metre."&mdash;"You forget, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," rejoined
the judge, "that we are prosing here."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Mr. Justice Willes was a judge of kindly disposition,
and when he had to convey a rebuke he did so in some
delicate and refined way like this. A young barrister
feeling in a hobble, wished to get out of it by saying,
"I throw myself on your lordship's hands."&mdash;"Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
I decline the burden," replied the learned judge.</p>

<p>One day in judge's chambers, after being pressed by
counsel very strongly against his own views, he said
with quaint humour: "I'm one of the most obstinate
men in the world."&mdash;"God forbid that I should be
so rude as to contradict your lordship," replied the
counsel.</p>

<p>Mr. Montague Williams in his <i>Leaves of a Life</i> relates
the following story of Mr. Justice Byles. He was
once hearing a case in which a woman was charged
with causing the death of her child by not giving it
proper food, or treating it with the necessary care.
Mr. F&mdash;&mdash;, of the Western Circuit, conducted the
defence, and while addressing the jury said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, it appears to be impossible that the
prisoner can have committed this crime. A mother
guilty of such conduct to her own child? Why, it is
repugnant to our better feelings"; and then being carried
away by his own eloquence, he proceeded: "Gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>tlemen,
the beasts of the field, the birds of the air,
suckle their young, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this point the learned judge interrupted him,
and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. F&mdash;&mdash;, if you establish the latter part of your
proposition, your client will be acquitted to a certainty."</p>

<p>And to the same authority we are indebted for a
judge's gentle but sarcastic reproof of a prosing counsel.
In an action for false imprisonment, heard before
Mr. Justice Wightman, Ribton was addressing the
jury at great length, repeating himself constantly, and
never giving the slightest sign of winding up. When
he had been pounding away for several hours, the good
old judge interposed, and said: "Mr. Ribton, you've
said that before."&mdash;"Have I, my lord?" said Ribton;
"I'm very sorry. I quite forgot it."&mdash;"Don't apologise,
Mr. Ribton," was the answer. "I forgive you; for it
was a very long time ago."</p>

<p>A very old story is told of a highwayman who sent
for a solicitor and inquired what steps were necessary
to be taken to have his trial deferred. The solicitor
answered that he would require to get a doctor's affidavit
of his illness. This was accordingly done in the
following manner: "The deponent verily believes that
if the said &mdash;&mdash; is obliged to take his trial at the ensuing
sessions, he will be in imminent danger of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>life."&mdash;"I verily believe so too," replied the judge, and
the trial proceeded immediately.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Some judges profess ignorance of slang terms used
in evidence, and seek explanation from counsel. Lord
Coleridge in the following story had his inquiry not
only answered but illustrated. A witness was describing
an animated conversation between the pursuer and
defendant in a case and said: "Then the defendant
turned and said, 'If 'e didn't 'owld 'is noise 'ed knock
'im off 'is peark.'"&mdash;"Peark? Mr. Shee, what is meant
by peark?" asked the Lord Chief Justice. "Oh, peark,
my lord, is any position when a man elevates himself
above his fellows&mdash;for instance, a bench, my lord."</p>

<p>Another story illustrating this alleged ignorance of
every-day terms used by the masses comes from the
Scottish Court of Session. In this instance the explanation
was volunteered by the witness who used
the term. One of the counsel in the case was Mr. (now
Lord) Dewar, who was cross-examining the witness on
a certain incident, and drew from him the statement
that he (the witness) had just had a "nip." "A nip,"
said the judge; "what is a nip?"&mdash;"Only a small Dewar,
my lord," explained the witness.</p>

<p>Lord Russell of Killowen, himself a Lord Chief Justice,
tells some amusing stories of Lord Coleridge in
his interesting reminiscences of that great judge in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span><i>North American Review</i>. When at the Bar he was
counsel in a remarkable case&mdash;Saurin against Starr.
The pursuer, an Irish lady, sued the Superior of a religious
order at Hull for expulsion without reasonable
cause. Mr. Coleridge cross-examined a Mrs. Kennedy,
one of the superintendents of the convent, who had
mentioned in her evidence, among other peccadilloes
of the pursuer, that she had been found in the pantry
eating strawberries, when she should have been attending
some class duties.</p>

<p>Mr. Coleridge: "Eating strawberries, really!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy: "Yes, sir, she was eating strawberries."</p>

<p>Mr. Coleridge: "How shocking!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy: "It was forbidden, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Coleridge: "And did you, Mrs. Kennedy, really
consider there was any great harm in that?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy: "No, sir, not in itself, any more
than there was harm in eating an apple; but you know,
sir, the mischief that came from that."</p>

<p>When as Lord Chief Justice, Lord Coleridge visited
the United States, he was continually pestered by interviewers,
and one of them failing to draw him, began
to disparage the old country in its physical features
and its men. Lord Coleridge bore it all in good part;
finally the interviewer said, "I am told, my lord, you
think a great deal of your great fire of London. Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>I guess, that the conflagration we had in the little village
of Chicago made your great fire look very small."
To which his lordship blandly responded: "Sir, I have
every reason to believe that the great fire of London
was quite as great as the people of that time desired."</p>

<p>There are few of Lord Bowen's witticisms from the
Bench in circulation, but his after-dinner stories are
worth recording, and perhaps one of the best is that
given in <i>Anecdotes of the Bench and Bar</i>, as told by
himself in the following words: "One of the ancient
rabbinical writers was engaged in compiling a history
of the minor prophets, and in due course it became his
duty to record the history of the prophet Daniel. In
speaking of the most striking incident in the great
man's career&mdash;I refer to his critical position in the den
of lions&mdash;he made a remark which has always seemed
to me replete with judgment and observation. He said
that the prophet, notwithstanding the trying circumstances
in which he was placed, had one consolation
which has sometimes been forgotten. He had the consolation
of knowing that when the dreadful banquet
was over, at any rate it was not he who would be called
upon to return thanks."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The following story cannot be classed a witticism
from the Bench, but the judge clearly gave the opening
for the lady's smart retort.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs. Weldon, a well-known lady litigant in the
Courts a generation ago, was on one occasion endeavouring
in the Court of Appeal to upset a judgment of
Vice-Chancellor Bacon, and one ground of complaint
was that the judge was too old to understand her case.
Thereupon Lord Esher said: "The last time you were
here you complained that your case had been tried by
my brother Bowen, and you said he was only a bit of a
boy, and could not do you justice. Now you come here
and say that my brother Bacon was too old. What age
do you want the judge to be?"&mdash;"Your age," promptly
replied Mrs. Weldon, fixing her bright eyes on the
handsome countenance of the Master of the Rolls.</p>

<p>On Charles Phillips, who became a judge of the Insolvent
Court, noticing a witness kiss his thumb instead
of the Testament, after rebuking him said, "You
may think to <i>desave</i> God, sir, but you won't desave
me."</p>

<span class="caption">SIR HENRY HAWKINS, LORD BRAMPTON.</span>
</div>

<p>That racy and turf-attending judge, Lord Brampton,
better known as Sir Henry Hawkins, tells many good
stories of himself in his <i>Reminiscences</i>, but it is the
unconscious humorist of Marylebone Police Court who
records this <i>bon mot</i> of Sir Henry.</p>

<p>An old woman in the witness-box had been rattling
on in the most voluble manner, until it was impossible
to make head or tail of her evidence. Mr. Justice Haw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>kins,
thinking he would try his hand, began with a
soothing question, but the old woman would not have
it at any price. She replied testily, "It's no use you
bothering me. I have told you all I know."&mdash;"That may
be," replied his lordship, "but the question rather is,
do you know all you have told us?"</p>

<p>When Sir Henry (then Mr.) Hawkins was prosecuting
counsel in the Tichborne trial, over which Lord
Chief Justice Cockburn presided, an amusing incident
is recorded by Mr. Plowden. The antecedents of a man
who had given sensational evidence for the claimant
were being inquired into, and in answer to Sir Henry
the witness under examination said he knew the man
to be married, but his wife passed under another name.
"What name?" asked Mr. Hawkins. "Mrs. Hawkins,"
replied the witness. "What was her maiden name?"
added Mr. Hawkins. "Cockburn." Such a coincident of
names naturally caused hearty and prolonged laughter.</p>

<p>In the course of this celebrated trial another amusing
incident occurred which Sir Henry used to tell
against himself. One morning as the claimant came
into Court, a lady dressed in deep mourning presented
Orton with a tract. After a few minutes he wrote something
on it, and had it passed on to the prosecuting
counsel. The tract was boldly headed in black type,
"Sinner&mdash;Repent," and the claimant had written upon
it, "Surely this must have been meant for Hawkins."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>Not long after he had ascended the Bench Mr. Justice
Hawkins was hearing a case in which a man was
being tried for murder. The counsel for the prosecution
observed the prisoner say something earnestly to
the policeman seated by his side in the dock, and asked
that the constable should be made to disclose what had
passed. "Yes," said his lordship, "I think you may demand
that. Constable, inform the Court what passed
between you and the prisoner."&mdash;"I&mdash;I would rather
not, your lordship. I was&mdash;."&mdash;"Never mind what you
would rather not do. Inform the Court what the prisoner
said."&mdash;"He asked me, your lordship, who that
hoary heathen with the sheepskin was, as he had often
seen him at the race-course."&mdash;"That will do," said
his lordship. "Proceed with the case."</p>

<p>An action for damages against a fire insurance company,
brought by some Jews, was heard before Chief
Justice Cockburn, which clearly was a fraudulent claim.
The plaintiffs claimed for loss of ready-made clothes
in the fire. Hawkins, who appeared for the defendant
company, elicited the fact that ready-made clothes
in this firm had all brass buttons as a rule; and, further,
that after sifting the debris of the fire no buttons had
been found. The trial was not concluded on that day,
but on the following morning hundreds of buttons
partially burnt were brought into Court by the Jew
plaintiffs. Cockburn was not long in appreciating this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>mode of furnishing evidence after its necessity had
been pointed out, and he asked: "How do you account
for these buttons, Mr. Hawkins? You said none were
found."&mdash;"Up to last night none had been found," replied
Hawkins. "But," said the Chief Justice&mdash;"but
these buttons have evidently been burnt in the fire.
How do they come here?"&mdash;"<i>On their own shanks</i>,"
was Hawkins' smart and ready reply. Verdict for defendants.</p>

<p>The alibi has come in for its fair share of jests. Sir
Henry Hawkins relates in his <i>Reminiscences</i> how he
once found the following in his brief: "If the case is
called on before 3.15, the defence is left to the ingenuity
of the counsel; if after that hour, the defence is an
alibi, as by then the usual alibi witnesses will have returned
from Norwich, where they are at present professionally
engaged."</p>

<p>Sitting as a vacation judge, Sir Walter Phillimore,
whose views on the law of divorce are well known,
protested against being called on to make absolute a
number of decrees <i>nisi</i> granted in the Divorce Division.
This fact is said to have called forth a witty pronouncement
by a late president of that Division of the Courts.
"Here is my brother Phillimore, who objects to making
decrees <i>nisi</i> absolute because he believes in the sanctity
of the marriage tie. By and by we may be having
a Unitarian appointed to the Bench, and he will refuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>to try Admiralty suits, as he would have to sit with
Trinity Masters."</p>

<p>In sentencing a burglar recently, the judge referred
to him as a "professional," to which the prisoner
strongly protested from the dock. "Here," he exclaimed,
"I dunno wot you mean by callin' me a professional
burglar. I've only done it once before, an' I've been
nabbed both times." The judge, in the most suave
manner, replied, "Oh, I did not mean to say that you
had been very successful in your profession."</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Grantham had a keen sense of humour.
On one occasion, when he was judge at the Newcastle
Assizes, he left the mansion-house where he was staying,
at night, to post his letters. As he was wearing a
cap he was not recognised by the police officer who
was on duty outside, and the constable inquired of his
lordship if "the old &mdash;&mdash; had gone to bed yet." The
judge replied that he thought not, and a short while

window, and putting out his head called to the
constable below: "Officer, the old &mdash;&mdash; is just going to

<p>Hardly a case of any importance comes into Mr. Justice
Darling's Court without attracting a large attendance
of the public, as much from expectation of being
entertained by the repartees between Bench and Bar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>as from interest in the proceedings before the Court.
In a recent turf libel case his lordship gave a free rein
to his proclivity to give an amusing turn to statements
of both counsel and witnesses. At one point he
intervened by remarking that other witnesses than the one
under examination had said that a horse is made fit by
running on the course before he is expected to win a
position, and added, "That is so, not only on the race-course.
You can never make a good lawyer by putting
him to read in the library." To which the defendant,
who conducted his own case, replied, "But I take it a
barrister does try."&mdash;"You have no notion how he tries
the judge," responded Mr. Justice Darling. In the same
case a question arose as to whether the stewards of
the Jockey Club had the power to check riding "short,"
as it is termed, and the Justice inquired if the stewards
could say, "You must ride with a leather of a prescribed
length," and got the answer, "Yes; they could say if
you don't ride longer we won't give you a license."&mdash;"Which
means," said the judge, "if you don't ride
longer you won't ride long."</p>

<p>"Who made the translation from the German?"
asked the same judge, regarding a document to which
counsel had referred. "God knows; I don't," was the
reply of Mr. Danckwerts. "Are you sure," responded
the Justice, "that what is not known to you is known
at all?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Justice Darling never raised heartier
laughter than in an action some years ago where the
issue was whether the plaintiff, who had been engaged
by the defendant to sing in "potted opera" at a music-hall,
was competent to fulfil his contract.</p>

<p>"Well, he could not sing like the archangel Gabriel,"
a witness had said, in reply to Mr. Duke, K. C.</p>

<p>"I have never heard the archangel Gabriel," commented
the eminent counsel.</p>

<p>"That, Mr. Duke, is a pleasure to come," was his
lordship's swift, if gently sarcastic, rejoinder.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>If witnesses occasionally undergo severe handling
in cross-examination by counsel, there are also occasions
when their ready reply has rather nonplussed
the judge.</p>

<p>A case was being tried at York before Mr. Justice
Gould. When it had proceeded for upwards of two
hours the judge observed that there were only eleven
jurymen in the box, and inquired where the twelfth
man was. "Please you, my lord," said one of them,
"he has gone away about some business, but he has
left his verdict with me."</p>

<p>"How old are you?" asked the judge of a lady witness.
"Thirty."&mdash;"Thirty!" said the judge; "I have
heard you give the same age in this Court for the last
three years."&mdash;"Yes," responded the lady; "I am not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>one of those persons who say one thing to-day and another
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Keating one day had occasion to examine
a witness who stuttered very much in giving his
evidence. "I believe," said his lordship, "you are a very
great rogue."&mdash;"Not so great a rogue as you, my lord&mdash;t&mdash;t&mdash;t&mdash;t&mdash;take
me to be," was the reply.</p>

<p>Judge: "Is this your signature?"</p>

<p>Witness: "I don't know."</p>

<p>Judge: "Look at it carefully."</p>

<p>Witness: "I can't say for certain."</p>

<p>Judge: "Is it anything like your writing?"</p>

<p>Witness: "I don't think it is."</p>

<p>Judge: "Can't you identify it?"</p>

<p>Witness: "Not quite."</p>

<p>Judge: "Well, let me see, just write your name here
and I will examine the two signatures."</p>

<p>Witness: "I can't write, sir."</p>

<p>Medical men are not as a rule the best witnesses, being
too fond of using technical words peculiar to them
in their own profession. In an action for assault tried
by a Derbyshire common jury before Mr. Justice Patteson,
a surgical witness was asked to describe the injuries
the plaintiff had received; he stated he had "ecchymosis"
of the left eye. Upon the judge inquiring
whether that did not mean what was commonly understood
by a black eye, the witness answered: "Yes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>&mdash;"Then
why did you not say so, sir? What do the jury
know of 'ecchymosis'? They might think, as the farmer
did of the word 'felicity,' used by a clergyman in his
sermon, that it meant something in the inside of a pig."</p>

<p>A notorious thief, being tried for his life, confessed
the robbery he was charged with. The judge thereupon
directed the jury to find him guilty upon his own confession.
The jury having consulted together brought
him in "Not guilty." The judge bade them consider
their verdict again, but still they brought in a verdict
of "Not guilty." The judge asking the reason, the foreman
replied: "There is reason enough, for we all know
him to be one of the greatest liars in the country."</p>

<p>"Have you committed all these crimes?" asked the
judge of a hoary old sinner. "Yes, my lord, and worse."
"Worse, I should have thought it impossible. What
have you done then?"&mdash;"My lord, I allowed myself to
be caught."</p>

<p>"I knows yer," said a prisoner to the present Lord
Chief Justice, "and many's the time I've given yer a
hand when ye've been stepping it round the track like
a greyhound. So let's down lightly, like a good cove
as yer are."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The retort of a witness to Lord Avory was too good
to be soon forgotten, and is still circulating among the
juniors of the law-courts. "Let me see," said his lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>ship,
"you have been convicted before, haven't you?"&mdash;"Yes,
sir," answered the man; "but it was due to
the incapacity of my counsel rather than to any fault
on my part."&mdash;"It always is," said Lord Avory, with a
grim smile, "and you have my sincere sympathy."&mdash;"And
I deserve it," retorted the man, "seeing that you
were my counsel on that occasion!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO<br />
THE BARRISTERS OF ENGLAND</h2>




<p>From the middle of the thirteenth
century the senior rank to which a barrister could attain
at the Bar was that of serjeant-at-law, and from
that body, which existed until 1875, the judges were
selected. If a barrister below the rank of serjeant was
invited to take a seat on the Bench he invariably conformed
to the recognised custom and "took the coif"&mdash;became
a serjeant-at-law&mdash;before he was sworn as
one of his (or her) Majesty's judges. This explains
the term "brother" applied by judges when addressing
serjeants pleading before them in Court. "Taking
the coif" had a curious origin. It was customary in
very early times for the clergy to add to their clerical
duties that of a legal practitioner, by which considerable
fees were obtained, and when the Canon law forbade
them engaging in all secular occupations the remuneration
they had obtained from the law-courts
proved too strong a temptation to evade the new law.
They continued therefore to practise in the Courts, and
to hide their clerical identity they concealed the tonsure
by covering the upper part of their heads with a
black cap or coif. When ultimately clerical barristers
were driven from the law-courts, the "coif" or black
patch on the crown of a barrister's wig became the
symbol of the rank of serjeant-at-law. That this distinguishing
mark has been, in later years, occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>misunderstood is illustrated in the story of Serjeant
Allen and Sir Henry Keating, Q.C., who were opposed
to one another in a case before the Assize Court at
Stafford. During the hearing of the case a violent altercation
had taken place between them, but when the
Court rose they left the building together, walking
amicably to their lodgings. Two men who had been in
Court and had heard their wrangle were following behind
them, when one said to the other: "If you was in
trouble, Bill, which o' them two tip-top 'uns would you
have to defend you?"&mdash;"Well, Jim," was the reply,
"I should pitch upon this 'un," pointing to the Q.C.
"Then you'd be a fool," said his companion; "the fellow
with the <i>sore head</i> is worth six of t'other 'un."</p>

<p>There used to be a student joke against the serjeants.
"Why is a serjeant's speech like a tailor's
goose?"&mdash;"Because it is hot and heavy."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Taking silk," or becoming a K.C. and a senior at
the Bar, originated at a much later date than that of
serjeant-at-law. Lord Bacon was the first to be recognised
as Queen's Counsel, but this distinction arose
from his position as legal adviser to Queen Elizabeth,
and did not indicate the existence of a senior
body (as K.C. does now) among the barristers of that
period. The institution of the rank dates from the days
of Charles II, when Sir Francis North, Lord Guildford,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>was created King's Counsel by a writ issued under
the Great Seal. As was customary in the case of a
barrister proposing to "take the coif," so in that of
one proposing to "take silk"; he intimates to the seniors
already holding the rank that he intends to apply for
admission to the body. A story is current in the Temple
that when Mr. Justice Eve "took silk" the usual
notification of his intention was sent to the seniors,
and from one of them he received the following reply:
"My dear Eve, whether you wear silk or a fig-leaf, I
do not care.&mdash;A Dam."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Our selection of faceti&aelig; of the English Bar, therefore,
naturally opens with stories of the serjeants-at-law,
and one of the best-known members of that body
in early days was Serjeant Hill, a celebrated lawyer,
who was also somewhat remarkable for absence of
mind, which was attributed to the earnestness with
which he devoted himself to his professional duties.</p>

<p>On the very day when he was married, he had an
intricate case on hand, and forgot his engagement,
until reminded of his waiting bride, and that the legal
time for performing the ceremony had nearly elapsed.
He then quitted law for the church; after the ceremony,
the serjeant returned to his books and his papers,
having forgotten the <i>cause</i> he had been engaged in
during the morning, until again reminded by his clerk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>that the assembled company impatiently awaited his
presence at dinner.</p>

<p>Being once on Circuit, and having occasion to refer
to a law authority, he had recourse, as usual, to his bag;
but, to the astonishment of the Court, instead of a volume
of Viner's abridgment, he took out a specimen
candlestick, the property of a Birmingham traveller,
whose bag Serjeant Hill had brought into Court by
mistake.</p>

<p>A learned serjeant kept the Court waiting one morning
for a few minutes. The business of the Court commenced
at nine. "Brother," said the judge, "you are
behind your time this morning. The Court has been
waiting for you."&mdash;"I beg your lordship's pardon,"
replied the serjeant; "I am afraid I was longer than
usual in dressing."&mdash;"Oh," returned the judge, "I can
dress in five minutes at any time."&mdash;"Indeed!" said
the learned brother, a little surprised for the moment;
"but in that my dog Shock beats your lordship hollow,
for he has nothing to do but to shake his coat, and
thinks himself fit for any company."</p>

<p>Serjeant Davy, when at the height of his professional
career, once received a large brief on which a fee of two
guineas only was marked on the back. His client asked
him if he had read the brief. Pointing with his finger
to the fee, Davy replied: "As far as that I have read,
and for the life of me I can read no further." Of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>same eminent serjeant in his earlier years an Old
Baily story is told. Judge Gould, who presided, asked:
"Who is concerned for the prisoner?"&mdash;"I am concerned
for him, my lord," said Davy, "and very much
concerned after what I have just heard."</p>

<p>If Serjeant Davy was concerned about his client,
Serjeant Miller had no such scruple about the man
charged with horse stealing whom he successfully defended,
although the evidence convinced the judge and
everybody in the Court that there ought to have been a
conviction. When the trial was over and the prisoner
had been acquitted, the judge said to him: "Prisoner,
luckily for you, you have been found Not Guilty by the
jury, but you know perfectly well you stole that horse.
You may as well tell the truth, as no harm can happen
to you now by a confession, for you cannot be tried
again. Now tell me, did you not steal that horse?"
"Well, my lord," replied the man, "I always thought
I did, until I heard my counsel's speech, but now I
begin to think I didn't."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the days of "riding" and "driving circuit," and
even later, the Circuit mess was a very popular institution
with circuiteers, and was made the occasion of
much merriment. After the table had been cleared a
fictitious charge would be made against one of the barristers
present, and a mock tribunal was immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>constituted before which he was arraigned and his case
duly set forth with all solemnity. The victim was invariably
fined&mdash;generally in wine, which had to be paid
at once, and consumed before the company retired to
bed. On one such occasion Serjeant Prime, who is represented
as a good-natured but rather dull man, and
as a barrister wearisome beyond comparison, was engaged
in an important case in an over-crowded courtroom.
He had been speaking for three hours, when a
boy, seated on a beam above the heads of the audience,
overcome by the heat and the serjeant's monotonous
tones, fell asleep, and, losing his balance, tumbled down
on the people below. The incident was made the subject
of a charge against the serjeant at the mess, and he
was duly sentenced to pay a fine of two dozen of wine,
which he did with the greatest good humour.</p>

<p>Serjeant Wilkins, on one occasion, on defending a
prisoner, said: "Drink has upon some an elevating,
upon others a depressing, effect; indeed, there is a report,
as we all know, that an eminent judge, when at
the Bar, was obliged to resort to heavy drinking in the
morning, to reduce himself to the level of the judges."
Lord Denman, the judge, who had no love for Wilkins,
bridled up instantly. His voice trembled with indignation
as he uttered the words: "Where is the report,
sir? Where is it?" There was a death-like silence.
Wilkins calmly turned round to the judge and said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>"It was burnt, my lord, in the Temple fire." The effect
of this was considerable, and it was a long time before
order could be restored, but Lord Denman was one of
the first to acknowledge the wit of the answer.</p>

<p>Difference of manner or temperament sometimes
gives point to the collisions which occasionally occur
in Court between rival counsel. Serjeant Wilkins, who
had an inflated style of oratory, was once opposed in
a case to Serjeant Thomas, whose manner of delivery
was lighter and more lively. On the conclusion of a
heavy bombardment of ponderous Johnsonian sentences
from the former, Thomas rose, and, with his
eyes fixed on his opponent, prefaced his address to the
jury with the words, delivered with much solemnity of
manner and intonation: "And now the hurly-burly's
done."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Dunning was defending a gentleman in an action
brought from <i>crim. con.</i> with the plaintiff's wife. The
chief witness for the plaintiff was the lady's maid, a
clever, self-composed person, who spoke confidently
as to seeing the defendant in bed with her mistress.
Dunning, on rising to cross-examine her, first made her
take off her bonnet, that they might have a good view
of her face, but this did not discompose her, as she
knew she was good-looking. He then arranged his
brief, solemnly drew up his shirt sleeves, and then be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>gan:
"Are you sure it was not your master you saw in
bed with your mistress?"&mdash;"Perfectly sure."&mdash;"What,
do you pretend to say you can be certain when the head
only appeared from the bedclothes, and that enveloped
in a nightcap?"&mdash;"Quite certain."&mdash;"You have often
found occasion, then, to see your master in his
nightcap?"&mdash;"Yes&mdash;very frequently."&mdash;"Now, young
woman, I ask you, on your solemn oath, does not your
master occasionally go to bed with you?"&mdash;"Oh, that
trial does not come on to-day, Mr. Slabberchops!" replied
the witness. A loud shout of laughter followed,
and Lord Mansfield leaned back to enjoy it, and then
gravely leaned forward and asked if Mr. Dunning had
any more questions to put to the witness. No answer
was given, and none were put. The same counsel,
when at the height of his large practice at the Bar, was
asked how he got through all his work. He replied: "I
do one-third of it; another third does itself; and I don't
do the remaining third."</p>

<p>A witness under severe cross-examination by Serjeant
Dunning was repeatedly asked if he did not live
close to the Court. On admitting that he did, the further
question was put, "And pray, sir, for what reason did
you take up your residence in that place?"&mdash;"To avoid
the rascally impertinence of dunning," came the ready
answer.</p>

<p>A barrister's name once gave a witness the opport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>unity
to score in the course of a severe cross-examination.
Missing was the leader of his Circuit and was defending
his client charged with stealing a donkey. The
prosecutor had left the donkey tied up to a gate, and
when he returned it was gone. "Do you mean to say,"
said counsel, "the donkey was stolen from the gate?"&mdash;"I
mean to say, sir," said the witness, giving the
judge and then the jury a sly look, at the same time
pointing to the counsel, "the ass was missing."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Mr. Clarke, a leader of the Midland Circuit, was a
very worthy lawyer of the old school. A client long refusing
to agree to refer to arbitration a cause which
judge, jury, and counsel wished to get rid of, he at last
said to him, "You d&mdash;d infernal fool, if you do not
immediately follow his lordship's recommendation, I
shall be obliged to use strong language to you." Once,
in a council of the Benchers of Lincoln's Inn, the same
gentleman very conscientiously opposed their calling
a Jew to the Bar. Some tried to point out the hardship
to be imposed upon the young gentleman, who had
been allowed to keep his terms, and whose prospects
in life would thus be suddenly blasted. "Hardship!"
said the zealous churchman, "no hardship at all! Let
him become a Christian, and be d&mdash;d to him!"</p>

<p>It is sometimes imagined by laymen that verdicts
may be obtained by the trickery of counsel. Doubtless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>counsel may try to throw dust in the eyes of jurors,
but they are not very successful. Lord Campbell tells
a story of Clarke, who by such tactics brought a case
to a satisfactory compromise. The attorney, coming to
him privately, said, "Sir, don't you think we have got
very good terms? But you rather went beyond my instructions."&mdash;"You
fool!" retorted Clarke; "how do
you suppose you could have got such terms if I had
stuck to your instructions."</p>

<span class="caption">JOHN ADOLPHUS, BARRISTER.</span>
</div>

<p>In the biography of John Adolphus, a famous criminal
lawyer, we are told that the judges of his time were
much impressed with the following table of degrees.
"The three degrees of comparison in a lawyer's progress
are: getting on; getting on-er (honour); getting
on-est (honest)." He declared the judges acknowledged
much truth in the degrees. The third degree
in Mr. Adolphus' table reminds us of the story of
the farmer who was met by the head of a firm of solicitors,
who inquired the name of a plant the farmer
was carrying. "It's a plant," replied the latter, "that
will not grow in a lawyer's garden; it is called honesty."</p>

<p>One night, walking through St. Giles's by way of a
short cut towards home, an Irish woman came up to
Mr. Adolphus. "Why, Misther Adolphus! and who'd a'
thought of seeing you in the Holy Ground?"&mdash;"And
how came you to know who I am?" said Adolphus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>"Lord bless and save ye, sir! not know ye? Why, I'd
know ye if ye was boiled up in a soup!"</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu Chambers was counsel for a widow
who had been put in a lunatic asylum, and sued the
two medical men who signed the certificate of her insanity.
The plaintiff's case was to prove that she was
not addicted to drinking, and that there was no pretence
for treating hers as a case of <i>delirium tremens</i>.
Dr. Tunstal, the last of plaintiff's witnesses, described
one case in which he had cured a patient of <i>delirium
tremens</i> in a <i>single night</i>, and he added, "It was a case
of gradual drinking, <i>sipping all day</i> from morning till
night." These words were scarcely uttered when Mr.
Chambers rose in triumph, and said, "My lord, that is
<i>my case</i>."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On the Northern Circuit a century ago, there was a
famous barrister who was familiarly known among his
brother advocates as Jack Lee. He was engaged in
examining one Mary Pritchard, of Barnsley, and began
his examination with, "Well, Mary, if I may credit
what I hear, I may venture to address you by the name
of Black Moll."&mdash;"Faith you may, mister lawyer, for I
am always called so by the blackguards." On another
occasion he was retained for the plaintiff in an action
for breach of promise of marriage. When the consultation
took place, he inquired whether the lady for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>whose injury he was to seek redress was good-looking.
"Very handsome indeed, sir," was the assurance of
her attorney. "Then, sir," replied Lee, "I beg you
will request her to be in Court, and in a place where
she can be seen." The attorney promised compliance,
and the lady, in accordance with Lee's wishes, took
her seat in a conspicuous place, where the jury could
see her. Lee, in addressing the jury, did not fail to insist
with great warmth on the "abominable cruelty"
which had been exercised towards "the highly attractive
and modest girl who trusted her cause to their
discernment"; and did not sit down until he had succeeded
in working upon their feelings with great and,
as he thought, successful effect. The counsel on the
other side, however, speedily broke the spell with
which Lee had enchanted the jury, by observing that
"his learned friend, in describing the graces and
beauty of the plaintiff, ought in common fairness not
to have concealed from the jury the fact that the lady
had a <i>wooden leg</i>!" The Court was convulsed with
laughter at this discovery, while Lee, who was ignorant
of this circumstance, looked aghast; and the jury,
ashamed of the influence that mere eloquence had had
upon them, returned a verdict for the defendant.</p>

<p>Justice Willes, the son of Chief Justice Willes, had
an offensive habit of interrupting counsel. On one
occasion an old practitioner was so irritated by this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>practice that he retorted sharply by saying, "Your
lordship doubtless shows greater acuteness even than
your father, the Chief Justice, for he used to understand
me <i>after I had done</i>, but your lordship understands
me even <i>before I have begun</i>."</p>

<p>Of Whigham, a later leader on the Northern Circuit,
an amusing story used to be told. He was defending a
prisoner, and opened an alibi in his address to the jury,
undertaking to prove it by calling the person who had
been in bed with his client at the time in question, and
deprecating their evil opinion of a woman whose moral
character was clearly open to grave reproach, but who
was still entitled to be believed upon her oath. Then
he called "Jessie Crabtree." The name was, as usual,
repeated by the crier, and there came pushing his way
sturdily through the crowd a big Lancashire lad in his
rough dress, who had been the prisoner's veritable
bedfellow&mdash;Whigham's brief not having explained to
him that the Christian name of his witness was, in this
case, a male one.</p>

<p>Colman, in his <i>Random Records</i>, tells the following
anecdote of the witty barrister, Mr. Jekyll. One day
observing a squirrel in Colman's chambers, in the
usual round cage, performing the same operation as
a man in a tread-mill, and looking at it for a minute,
exclaimed, "Oh! poor devil, he's going the Home
Circuit."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>Jekyll was asked why he no longer spoke to a lawyer
named Peat; to which he replied, "I choose to
give up his acquaintance&mdash;I have common of turbary,
and have a right to cut <i>peat</i>!" An impromptu of his
on a learned serjeant who was holding the Court of
Common Pleas with his glittering eye, is well known:</p>

<div class="poetryblock">

<span class="i0">"Behold the serjeant full of fire,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">His arguments <i>go to it</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. H. L. Adam, in his volume <i>The Story of Crime</i>,
tells an amusing story of a prisoner whose counsel had
successfully obtained his acquittal on a charge of brutal
assault. A policeman came across a man one night
lying unconscious on the pavement, and near by him
was an ordinary "bowler" hat. That was the only clue
to the perpetrator of the deed. The police had their
suspicions of a certain individual, whom they proceeded
to interrogate. In addition to being unable to give a
satisfactory account of his movements on the night of
the assault, it was found that the "bowler" hat in question
fitted him like a glove. He was accordingly arrested
and charged with the crime, the hat being the
chief evidence against him. Counsel for the defence,
however, dwelt so impressively on the risk of accepting
such evidence that the jury brought in a verdict of
"not proven," and the prisoner was discharged. Be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>fore
leaving the dock he turned to the judge, and
pointing to the hat in Court, said, "My lord, may I 'ave

<p>Some amusing scenes have occurred in suits brought
by tailors and dressmakers to recover the price of
garments for which their customers have declined to
pay on the ground of misfit. Serjeant Ballantine, in
his <i>Experiences of a Barrister</i>, relates the case of a
tailor in which the defendant was the famous Sir
Edwin Landseer. It was tried in the Exchequer Court,
before Baron Martin. "The coat was produced," says
the serjeant, "and the judge suggested that Sir Edwin
should try it on; he made a wry face, but consented,
and took off his own upper garment. He then put an
arm into one of the sleeves of that in dispute, and made
an apparently ineffectual endeavour to reach the other,
following it round amidst roars of laughter from all
parts of the Court. It was a common jury, and I was
told that there was a tailor upon it, upon which I suggested
that there was a gentleman of the same profession
as the plaintiff in Court who might assist Sir
Edwin. This was acceded to, and out hopped a little
Hebrew slop-seller from the Minories, to whom the
defendant submitted his body. With difficulty he got
into the coat, and then stood as if spitted, his back one
mass of wrinkles. The tableau was truly amusing; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>indignant plaintiff looking at the performance with
mingled horror and disgust; Sir Edwin, as if he were
choking; whilst the juryman, with the air of a connoisseur,
was examining him and the coat with profound
gravity. At last the judge, when able to stifle his
laughter, addressing the little Hebrew, said, 'Well,
Mr. Moses, what do you say?'&mdash;'Oh,' cried he, holding
up a pair of hands not over clean, and very different
from those encased in lavender gloves which graced
the plaintiff, 'it ish poshitively shocking, my lord; I
should have been ashamed to turn out such a thing
from my establishment.' The rest of the jury accepted
his view, and Sir Edwin, apparently relieved from suffocation,
entered his own coat with a look of relief,
which again convulsed the Court, bowed, and departed."</p>

<p>Financial prosecutions are as a rule very dreary,
and any little joke perpetrated by counsel during the
course of them is a relief. One was being heard, in
which Mr. Muir was counsel, and to many of his statements
the junior counsel for the prosecution shook his
head vehemently, although he said nothing. This continual
dumb contradiction at length got on the customary
patience of Mr. Muir, who blurted out: "I do not
know why my friend keeps shaking his head, whether
it is that he has palsy, or that there's nothing in it!"</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin was the counsel employed to oppose a
person justifying bail in the Court of King's Bench.
After some common questions, a waggish counsel sitting
near suggested that the witness should be asked
as to his having been a prisoner in Gloucester gaol.
Mr. Baldwin thereon boldly asked: "When, sir, were
you last in Gloucester gaol?" The witness, a respectable
tradesman, with astonishment declared that he
never was in a gaol in his life. Mr. Baldwin being
foiled after putting the question in various ways, turned
round to his friendly prompter, and asked for what
the man had been imprisoned. He was told that it was
for suicide. Thereupon Mr. Baldwin, with great gravity
and solemnity addressed the witness: "Now, sir, I
ask you upon your oath, and remember that I shall
have your words taken down, were you not imprisoned
in Gloucester gaol for suicide?"</p>

<p>A young lawyer who had just "taken the coif," once
said to Samuel Warren, the author of <i>Ten Thousand

with Oily Gammon?"&mdash;"Oh," replied Warren, "I
made a serjeant of him, and of course he never was
heard of afterwards."</p>

took place.</p>

counsel; "see my clerk&mdash;."&mdash;"Yessir," continued
the thief; "but I thought I'd like to make sure you'd

shifting about uneasily, "I was going to arst you, sir,
to take a little less. You see, sir (wheedlingly), it's

counsel impatiently. "Clear out!"&mdash;"But, sir, you've

<p>Serjeant Adams, who acted as assistant judge at
the sessions, had a very pleasant wit, and knew how
to deal with any counsel who took to "high-falutin."
On one occasion, after an altercation with the judge,
the counsel for the prisoner in his address to the jury
reminded them that "they were the great palladium of
British Liberty&mdash;that it was <i>their</i> province to deal
with the facts, the <i>judge</i> with the law&mdash;that they formed
one of the great institutions of their country, and
that they came in with William the Conqueror."
Adams at the end of his summing up said: "Gentlemen,
you will want to retire to consider your verdict,
and as it seems you came in with the Conqueror you
can now go out with the beadle."</p>

<p>There was always a mystery how Edwin James,
who at the Bar was earning an income of at least
&pound;10,000 a year, was continually in monetary difficulties.
Like Sir Thomas Lawrence, he must have
had some private drain on his resources which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>never disclosed. Among others who suffered was the
landlord of his chambers, whose rent was very much
in arrear. In the end the landlord hit upon a plan to
discover which would be the best method of recovering
his rent, and one day asked James to advise him
on a legal matter in which he was interested, and
thereupon drew up a statement of his grievance against
his own tenant. The paper was duly returned to the
landlord next day with the following sentence subjoined:
"In my opinion this is a case which admits of
only one remedy&mdash;patience. Edwin James."</p>

<p>In a case before Lord Campbell, James took a line
with a witness which his lordship considered quite inadmissible,
and stopped him. When summing up to
the jury Lord Campbell thought to soften his interruption
by saying: "You will have observed, gentlemen,
that I felt it my duty to stop Mr. Edwin James
in a certain line which he sought to adopt in the cross-examination
of one of the witnesses; but at the same
time I had no intention to cast any reflection on the
learned counsel who I am sure is known to you all as
a most able&mdash;" but before his lordship could proceed
any further James interposed, and in a contemptuous
voice exclaimed: "My lord, I have borne your lordship's
censure, spare me your lordship's praise."</p>

<p>Mr. W. G. Thorpe, F.S.A., in his entertaining vol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>ume
of <i>Middle Temple Table Talk</i>, relates a curious
story of a judge taking an extremely personal interest
in a case which was brought before him. A milk company
had sold off a lot of old stock to a cake-maker,
and the cake-maker had declined to pay because the
milk had turned out to be poisonous. As the case went
on the judge became more and more exercised. "What
do they do with this stuff?" he asked, pointing to a
mass of horrible mixture. "Oh, my lord, they make
cakes of it; it doesn't taste in the cakes."&mdash;"Where do
they sell these cakes?" was the judge's next question,
and the reply was, "They are used for certain railway
stations, school-treats, and excursions." Then the defendant
specified one of the places. "Bless me!" said
the judge, turning an olive-green, "I had some there
myself," and with a shudder he retired to his private
room, returning in a few minutes wiping his mouth.</p>

<p>There is another story of a counsel defending a
woman on a charge of causing the death of her husband
by administering a poisoned cake to him. "I'll
eat some of the cake myself," he said in Court, and took
a bite. Just at this moment a telegram was brought to
him to say that his wife was seriously ill, and he obtained
permission to leave in order to answer the message.
He returned, finished his speech, and obtained
the acquittal of his client. It transpired afterwards
that the telegram business was arranged in order that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>counsel could obtain an emetic after swallowing the
cake.</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu Williams tells a story, in his interesting
<i>Leaves of a Life</i>, of two members of the Bar, one
of whom had made a large fortune by his practice, but
worked too hard to enjoy his gains, while the other,
who only made a decent living, liked to enjoy life. They
met on one occasion at the end of a long vacation, and
the rich man asked his less fortunate brother what he
had been doing. "I have been on the Continent," the
other replied, "and I enjoyed my holiday very much.
What have you been doing?"&mdash;"I have been working,"
said the rich Q.C., "and have not been out of town;
I had lots of work to do."&mdash;"What is the use of
it?" queried the other; "you can't carry the money
with you when you die; and if you could, <i>it would
soon melt</i>."</p>

<p>From the same work we take the following story of
Serjeant Ballantine. On one occasion he was acting in

the solicitor whispered in Ballantine's ear: "Ask him

you're a Jew yourself," said the serjeant in some surprise.

<p>No collection of the wit and humour of the Bar
would be complete without some specimens of Sir
Frank Lockwood's racy sayings. From Mr. Augustine
Birrell's <i>Life of Lockwood</i> we quote the following:</p>

<p>"A tale is attached to Lockwood's first brief. It was
on a petition to the Master of the Rolls for payment
out of Court of a sum of money; and Lockwood appeared
for an official liquidator of a company whose
consent had to be obtained before the Court would
part with the fund. Lockwood was instructed to consent,
and his reward was to be three guineas on the
brief and one guinea for consultation. The petition
came on in due course before Lord Romilly, and was
made plain to him by counsel for the petitioner, and
still a little plainer by counsel for the principal respondent.</p>

<p>"Then up rose Lockwood, an imposing figure, and
indicated his appearance in the case.</p>

<p>"'What brings <i>you</i> here?' said Lord Romilly, meaning,
I presume, 'Why need I listen to you?'</p>

<p>"Lockwood looking puzzled, Lord Romilly added a
little testily, 'What do you come here for?'</p>

<p>"The answer was immediate, unexpected, and, accompanied
as it was by a dramatic glance at the out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>side
of his brief, as if to refresh his memory, triumphant,
'Three and one, my lord!'"</p>

<p>"The following letter is to Mrs. Atkinson:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<span class="smcap">1 Hare Court, Temple, E.C., London.</span>
<i>September 18, '72.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Loo</span>,&mdash;I trust it is well with yourself,
John, and the childer.... It is an off-day. We are
resting on our legal oars after a prolonged and determined
struggle yesterday. Know! that near our native
hamlet is the level of Hatfield Chase, whereon are
numerous drains. Our drain (speaking from the Corporation
of Hatfield Chase point of view) we have
stopped, for our own purposes. Consequently, the adjacent
lands have been flooded, are flooded, and will
continue to be flooded. The landed gentry wish us to
remove our dam, saying that if we don't they won't be
worth a d&mdash;n. We answer that we don't care a d&mdash;n.</p>

<p>This interesting case has been simmering in the
law-courts since 1820. The landed gentry got a verdict
in their favour at the last Lincoln Assizes, but
find themselves little the better, as we have appealed,
and our dam still reigns triumphant. Yesterday an
application was made to the judge to order our dam to
be removed. In the absence of Mellor, I donned my
forensic armour and did battle for the Corporation.
After two hours' hard fighting, we adjourned for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>week; in the meantime the floods may rise, and the
winds blow. The farmers yelled with rage when they
heard that the dam had got a week's respite. I rather
fancy that they will yell louder on Tuesday, as I hope
to win another bloodless victory. It is a pretty wanton
sport, the cream of the joke being that the dam is no
good to us or to anybody else, and we have no real objection
to urge against its removal, excepting that such
a measure would be informal, and contrary to the law
as laid down some hundred years ago by an old gentleman
who never heard of a steam-engine, and who
would have fainted at the sight of a telegraph post. As
we have the most money on our side, I trust we shall
win in the end. None of this useful substance, however,
comes my way, as it is Mellor's work. But I hope
to reap some advantage from it, both as to experience
and introduction. I make no apology for troubling you
with this long narration. I wish it to sink into your
mind, and into that of your good husband. Let it be a
warning to you and yours. And never by any chance
become involved in any difficulties which will bring
you into a court of law of higher jurisdiction than a
police court. An occasional 'drunk and disorderly'
will do you no harm, and only cost you 5<i>s.</i> Beyond a
little indulgence of this kind&mdash;beware! In all probability
I shall be in the North in a few weeks. Sessions
commence next month. I will write to the Mum this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>week.&mdash;With best love to all, I am, Your affectionate
brother,</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Frank Lockwood</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>"Mr. Mellor vouches for the following story, which,
as it illustrates Lockwood's humour and had gone the
round of the newspapers, I will tell. It is the ancient
custom of the new Lord Mayor of London, attended by
the Recorder and Sheriffs, to come into the law-courts
and be introduced to the Lord Chief Justice or, if he is
not there, to the senior judge to be found on the premises,
and, after a little lecture from the Bench, to return
good for evil by inviting the judges to dinner, only to
receive the somewhat chilling answer, 'Some of their
lordships will attend.' On this occasion the ceremony
was over, and the Lord Mayor and his retinue was retiring
from the Court, when his lordship's eye rested
on Lockwood, who in a new wig was one of the throng
by the door. 'Ah, my young friend!' said the Lord
Mayor in a pompous way (for in those days there was
no London County Council to teach Lord Mayors humility);
'picking up a little law, I suppose?' Lockwood
had his answer ready. With a profound bow, he replied:
'I shall be delighted to accept your lordship's
hospitality. I think I heard your lordship name seven
as the hour.' The Lord Mayor hurried out of Court,
and even the policeman (and to the police Lord Mayors
are almost divine) shook with laughter."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>
<p>Counsel sometimes find their position so weak that
their only hope of damaging the other side lies in ridiculing
their witnesses. Serjeant Parry on one occasion
was defending a client against a claim for breach of
promise of marriage made a few hours after a chance
meeting in Regent Street. According to the lady's
story the introduction had been effected through the
gentleman offering to protect her from a dog. In course
of cross-examination Parry said: "You say you were
alarmed at two dogs fighting, madam?"&mdash;"No, no, it
was a single dog," was the reply. "What you mean, madam,"
retorted Parry, "is that there was only one dog;
but whether it was a single dog or a married dog you
are not in a position to say." With this correction it need
not be wondered that the lady had little more to say.</p>

<p>A learned counsellor in the midst of an affecting appeal
in Court on a slander case delivered himself of the
following flight of genius. "Slander, gentlemen, like a
boa constrictor of gigantic size and immeasurable proportions,
wraps the coil of its unwieldy body about
its unfortunate victim, and, heedless of the shrieks of
agony that come from the utmost depths of its victim's
soul, loud and reverberating as the night thunder that
rolls in the heavens, it finally breaks its unlucky neck
upon the iron wheel of public opinion; forcing him first
to desperation, then to madness, and finally crushing
him in the hideous jaws of mortal death."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<p>Talking of his early days at the Bar, Mr. Thomas
Edward Crispe, in <i>Reminiscences of a K.C.</i>, relates how
on one occasion he was opposed by a somewhat eccentric
counsel named Wharton, known in his day as the
"Poet of Pump Court." The case was really a simple
one, but Wharton made so much of it that when the
luncheon half-hour came the judge, Mr. Justice Archibald,
with some emphasis, addressing Mr. Wharton,
said: "We will now adjourn, and, Mr. Wharton, I hope
you will take the opportunity of conferring with your
friend Mr. Crispe and settling the matter out of Court."</p>

<p>But Wharton would not agree to this, and when at
last he had to address the jury, he, in the course of his
speech, made the following remarks, for every word
of which Mr. Crispe vouches:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I think it only courteous to the learned
judge to refer to the advice his lordship gave me to
settle the matter out of Court. That reminds me of a
case, tried in a country court, in an action for detention
of a donkey. The plaintiff was a costermonger and the
defendant a costermonger; they conducted the case in
person. At one o'clock the judge said: 'Now, my men,
I'm going to have my lunch, and before I come back
I hope you'll settle your dispute out of Court.' When
he returned the plaintiff came in with a black eye and
the defendant with a bleeding nose, and the defendant
said: 'Well, your honour, we've taken your honour's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>advice; Jim's given me a good hiding, and I've given
him back his donkey.'"</p>

<p>Mr. F. E. Smith, M.P., tells a story of a County
Court case he was once engaged in, in which the
plaintiff's son, a lad of eight years, was to appear as a
witness.</p>

<p>When the youngster entered the box he wore boots
several sizes too large, a hat that almost hid his face,
long trousers rolled up so that the baggy knees were
at his ankles, and, to complete the picture, a swallow-tail
coat that had to be held to keep it from sweeping
the floor. This ludicrous picture was too much for the
Court; but the judge, between his spasms of laughter,
managed to ask the boy his reason for appearing in
such garb.</p>

<p>With wondering look the lad fished in an inner
pocket and hauled the summons from it, pointing out
a sentence with solemn mien as he did so: "To appear
in his father's suit" it read.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There have been few readier men in retort than the
late Mr. Francis Oswald, the author of <i>Oswald on
Contempt of Court</i>. After a stiff breeze in a Chancery
Court, the judge snapped out, "Well, I can't teach you
manners, Mr. Oswald."&mdash;"That is so, m'lud, that is so,"
replied the imperturbable one. On another occasion,
an irascible judge observed, "If you say another word,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>Mr. Oswald, I'll commit you."&mdash;"That raises another
point&mdash;as to your lordship's power to commit counsel
engaged in arguing before you," was the cool answer.</p>

<p>The author of <i>Pie Powder</i> in his entertaining volume,
tells us that he was once dining with a barrister who
had just taken silk. In the course of after-dinner talk,
the new K.C. invited his friend to tell him what he
considered was his (the K.C.'s) chief fault in style. After
some considerable hesitation his friend admitted that
he thought the K.C. erred occasionally in being too
long. This apparently somewhat annoyed the K.C.,
and his friend feeling he had perhaps spoken too freely,
thought he would smooth matters by inviting similar
criticism of himself from the K.C., who at once replied,
"My dear boy, I don't think really you have any fault.
<i>Except, you know, you are so d&mdash;d offensive.</i>"</p>

<p>A judge and a facetious lawyer conversing on the
subject of the transmigration of souls, the judge said,
"If you and I were turned into a horse and an ass,
which of them would you prefer to be?"&mdash;"The ass, to
be sure," replied the lawyer.&mdash;"Why?"&mdash;"Because,"
replied the lawyer, "I have heard of an ass being a
judge, but of a horse, never."</p>

<p>In some cases counsel receive answers to questions
which they had no business to put, and these, if not
quite to their liking, are what they justly deserve. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>following story of George Clarke, a celebrated negro
minstrel, is a case in point. On one occasion, when
being examined as a witness, he was severely interrogated
by a lawyer. "You are in the minstrel business,
I believe?" inquired the lawyer. "Yes, sir," was the
reply. "Is not that rather a low calling?"&mdash;"I don't
know but what it is, sir," replied the minstrel; "but it
is so much better than my father's that I am rather
proud of it." The lawyer fell into the trap. "What
was your father's calling?" he inquired. "He was a
lawyer," replied Clarke, in a tone that sent the whole
Court into a roar of laughter as the discomfited lawyer
sat down.</p>

<p>At the Durham Assizes an action was tried which
turned out to have been brought by one neighbour
against another for a trifling matter. The plaintiff was
a deaf old lady, and after a pause the judge suggested
that the counsel should get his client to compromise
it, and to ask her what she would take to settle it. Very
loudly counsel shouted out to his client: "His lordship
wants to know what you will take?" She at once
replied: "I thank his lordship kindly, and if it's no ill
convenience to him, I'll take a little <i>warm ale</i>."</p>

<p>A tailor sent his bill to a lawyer, and a message to

master that he was not running away, and was very
busy at the time. The messenger returned and said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>he must have the money. The lawyer testily answered,
"Did you tell your master that I was not running
away?"&mdash;"Yes, I did, sir; but he bade me tell you that
<i>he was</i>."</p>

<p>A well-known barrister at the criminal Bar, who
prided himself upon his skill in cross-examining a witness,
had an odd-looking witness upon whom to operate.
"You say, sir, that the prisoner is a thief?"&mdash;"Yes,
sir&mdash;'cause why, she confessed it."&mdash;"And you also
swear she did some repairs for you subsequent to the
confession?"&mdash;"I do, sir."&mdash;"Then," giving a knowing
look at the Court, "we are to understand that you employ
dishonest people to work for you, even after their
rascalities are known?"&mdash;"Of course! How else could
I get assistance from a lawyer?"&mdash;"Stand down!"
shouted the man of law.</p>

<p>At Worcester Assizes, a cause was tried as to the
soundness of a horse, and a clergyman had been a witness,
who gave a very confused account of the transaction,
and the matters he spoke to. A blustering
counsel on the other side, after many attempts to get
at the facts, said: "Pray, sir, do you know the difference
between a horse and a cow?"&mdash;"I acknowledge
my ignorance," replied the clergyman. "I hardly know
the difference between a horse and a cow, or between a
bully and a bull. Only a bull, I am told, has horns, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>a bully," bowing respectfully to the counsel, "<i>luckily
for me, has none</i>."</p>

<p>"In Court one day," says Mr. W. Andrews in <i>The
Lawyer</i>, "I heard the following sharp encounter between
a witness and an exceedingly irascible old-fashioned
solicitor who, among other things, hated
the modern custom of growing a beard or moustache.
He himself grew side-whiskers in the most approved
style of half a century ago. "Speak up, witness," he
shouted, "and don't stand mumbling there. If you
would shave off that unsightly moustache we might be
better able to hear what was coming out of your lips."
"And if you, sir," said the witness quietly, "would
shave off those side-whiskers you would enable my
words to reach your ears.""</p>

<p>"My friend," said an irritable lawyer, "you are an
ass."&mdash;"Do you mean, sir," asked the witness, "that I
am your friend because I am an ass, or an ass because
I am your friend?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Counsel sometimes comes to grief in dealing with
experts. "Do you," asked one of a scientist, "know of a
substance called Sulphonylic Diazotised Sesqui Oxide
of Aldehyde?" and he looked round triumphantly.
"Certainly," came the reply. "It is analogous in diatomic
composition of Para Sulpho Benzine Azode
Methyl Aniline in conjunction with Phehekato<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>line."
Counsel said he would pursue the matter no
further.</p>

<p>An action was brought by the owner of a donkey
which was forced against a wall by a waggon and
killed. The driver of the donkey was the chief witness,
and was much bullied by Mr. Raine, the defendant's
counsel, so that he lost his head and was reprimanded
by the judge for not giving direct answers, and looking
the jury in the face. Mr. Raine had a powerful
cast in his eye, which probably heightened the poor
fellow's confusion; and he continued to deal very severely
with the witness, reminding him again and
again of the judge's caution, saying: "Hold up your
head, man: look up, I say. Can't you hold up your
head, fellow? Can't you look as I do?" The witness,
with much simplicity, at once answered, "I can't, you
squint." On re-examination, Serjeant Cockle for the
plaintiff, seeing gleams of the witness's recovery from
his confusion, asked him to describe the position of
the waggon and the donkey. After much pressing, at
last he said, "Well, my lord judge, I'll tell you as how
it happened." Turning to Cockle, he said, "You'll
suppose ye are the wall."&mdash;"Aye, aye, just so, go on.
I am the wall, very good."&mdash;"Yes, sir, you are the
wall." Then changing his position a little, he said, "I
am the waggon."&mdash;"Yes, very good; now proceed, you
are the waggon," said the judge. The witness then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>looked to the judge, and hesitating at first, but with a
low bow and a look of sudden despair, said, "And
your lordship's the ass!"</p>

<p>Serjeant Cockle, who had a rough, blustering manner,
once got from a witness more than he gave. In
a trial of a right of fishery, he asked the witness:
"Dost thou love fish?"&mdash;"Aye," replied the witness,
with a grin, "but I donna like cockle sauce with it."
The learned serjeant was not pleased with the roar of
laughter which followed the remark.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Mr. H. L. Adam in <i>The Story of Crime</i> says he remembers
a very amusing incident in one of our police
courts. A prisoner had engaged a solicitor to defend
him, and while the latter was speaking on his behalf
he suddenly broke in with, "Why, he dunno wot the
devil he's talking abaht!" Thereupon the magistrate
informed him that if he was dissatisfied with his advocate's
capabilities, he could, if he chose, defend himself.
This he elected to do, and in the end was acquitted,
the magistrate remarking that had the case been
left to counsel he would unquestionably have been
convicted.</p>

<p>In cross-examining a witness, says Judge Parry in
<i>What the Judge Saw</i>, who had described the effects
of an accident, was confronted by counsel with his
statement, and asked, "But hadn't you told the doctor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>that your thigh was numb and had no feeling?"&mdash;"What's
the good o' telling him anything," replied
the witness. "That's where doctor made a mistake. I
told 'im I was numb i' front, and what does he do but
go and stick a pin into my back-side. 'E's no doctor."</p>

<p>From the same source is the following story. Another
man was testifying to an accident that had occurred
to him at the works where he was employed.
It was sought to prove that his testimony was false
because he had a holiday that day, and this poser was
put to him: "Do you mean to tell the Court that you
came to work when you might have been enjoying a
holiday?"&mdash;"Certainly."&mdash;"Why did you do that?"
The reply was too obviously truthful. "What should
I do? I have nowhere to go. I'm teetotal now."</p>

<p>A Jew had been condemned to be hanged, and was
brought to the gallows along with a fellow prisoner;
but on the road, before reaching the place of execution,
a reprieve arrived for the Jew. When informed of this,
it was expected that he would instantly leave the cart
in which he was conveyed, but he remained and saw
his fellow prisoner hanged. Being asked why he did
not at once go about his business, he said, "He was
waiting to see if he could bargain with Mr. Ketch for
the <i>other gentleman's clothes</i>!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p><p>A sign-painter presented his bill to a lawyer for payment.
After examining it the lawyer said, "Do you expect
any painter will go to heaven if they make such
charges as these?"&mdash;"I never heard of but one that
went," said the painter, "and he behaved so badly
that they determined to turn him out, but there being
no lawyer present to draw up the Writ of Ejectment,
he remained."</p>

<p>This must be the lawyer who, being refused entrance
to heaven by St. Peter, contrived to throw his
hat inside the door; and then, being permitted to go
and fetch it, took advantage of the Saint being fixed to
his post as doorkeeper and refused to come back again.</p>

<p>A solicitor who was known to occasionally exceed
the limit at lunch betrayed so much unsteadiness that
the magistrate quickly observed, "I think, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
you are not quite well, perhaps you had a little too
much wine at lunch."&mdash;"Quite a mistake, your worship,"
hiccoughed Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. "It was brandy and
water."</p>

<p>The son-in-law of a Chancery barrister having succeeded
to the lucrative practice of the latter, came one
morning in breathless haste to inform him that he had
succeeded in bringing nearly to its termination a cause
which had been pending in the Court for several years.
Instead of obtaining the expected congratulations of
the retired veteran of the law, his intelligence was received
with indignation. "It was by this suit," ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>claimed
he, "that my father was enabled to provide for
me, and to portion your wife, and with the exercise of
common prudence it would have furnished you with
the means of providing handsomely for your children
and grandchildren."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THREE<br />
THE JUDGES OF IRELAND</h2>


<p>In the days of Queen Anne corruption
was rife among Irish judges, as it was also among
members of the Scottish Bench at an earlier period,
and it was not uncommon to find the former concurring
in Privy Council reports issued contrary to evidence.
Within the area of the Munster Circuit in the early
years of the eighteenth century a petition was signed
and presented to Parliament by clergy, resident gentry,
and others in the district, because Lord Chancellor
Phipps refused to be influenced in his decision of cases
coming before him, and had thereby incurred the displeasure
of a certain section of the Irish Parliament.
Even a Lord Chief Justice was not above taking a gift;
and in this connection O'Flanagan in <i>The Munster
Circuit</i> tells a story of Chief Justice Pyne, who was a
great cattle-breeder and owner of valuable stock. One
day before starting for Cork Assizes to try a case in
which a Mr. Weller and a Mr. Nangle were concerned,
he received a visit from the former's steward, who had
been sent with a herd of twenty-five splendid heifers
for his lordship. The judge was highly pleased, and returned
by the steward a gracious message of thanks to
his master. On the way to Cork the Chief Justice's
coach was stopped by a drove of valuable shorthorns
on the road. Looking out, his lordship demanded of the
drover, "Whose beasts are these, my man?"&mdash;"They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>belong, please your honour, to a great gentleman of
these parts, Judge Pyne, your honour," replied the
man. "Indeed," cried the Chief Justice in much surprise,
"and where are you taking them now?"&mdash;"They
are grazing in my master Mr. Nangle's farm, your honour;
and as the Assizes are coming on at Cork my
master thought the judge might like to see that he took
good care of them, so I'm taking them to Waterpark
(his lordship's estate) to show to the judge." The judge
felt the delicacy of Mr. Nangle's mode of giving his
present, and putting a guinea in the drover's hand
said, "As your master has taken such good care of my
cattle, I will take care of him." When the case came
on it appeared at first that the judge favoured the
plaintiff, Mr. Weller, but as it proceeded he changed
his views and finally decided for the defendant, Mr.
Nangle. On arriving home the judge's first question
was, "Are the cattle all safe?"&mdash;"Perfectly, my lord."&mdash;"Where
are the beasts I received on leaving for the
Cork Assizes?"&mdash;"They are where you left them, my
lord."&mdash;"Where I left them&mdash;that is impossible," exclaimed
the judge. "I left them on the road." The steward
looked puzzled. "I'll have a look at them myself,"
said Chief Justice Pyne. The steward led the way, and
pointed out the twenty-five fine heifers presented by
Mr. Weller, the plaintiff. "But where are the shorthorns
that came after I left home?"&mdash;"Bedad, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>long and the short of it is, them's all the cattle on the
land, except what we have bred ourselves, my lord."
And so it was. Mr. Nangle, the defendant, had so arranged
his gift to meet the judge on the road, but as
soon as his lordship's coach was out of sight the cattle
were driven back to their familiar fields. The Chief
Justice had been outwitted and had no power of showing
resentment.</p>

<p>In the manners and customs of the legal profession
of Ireland in the latter part of the eighteenth century,
there is also a strong similarity between the members
of the Scottish Bench and their Irish brethren, in that
they were heavy port drinkers; and did not hesitate
to indulge in it while sitting on the Bench. It is reported
of one Irish judge that he had a specially constructed
metal tube like a penholder, through which
he sucked his favourite liquor, from what appeared to
the audience to be a metal inkstand. Another judge on
being asked if, at a social gathering, he had seen a
learned brother dance, "Yes," he replied, "I saw him
in a <i>reel</i>"; while Curran referring to a third judge, who
had condemned a prisoner to death, said, "He did not
weep, but he had a drop in his eye."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Unblushing effrontery and a bronzed visage gained
for John Scott (Lord Clonmel) while at the Bar the sobriquet
of "Copper-faced Jack." He took the popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>side in politics, which ordinarily would not have led to
promotion in his profession; but his outstanding ability
attracted the attention of Lord Chancellor Lifford,
and through his influence Scott was offered a place
under the Government. On accepting it at the hands
of Lord Townshend, he said, "My lord, you have spoiled
a good patriot." Some time after he met Flood, a
co-patriot, and addressed him: "Well, I suppose you
will be abusing me as usual." To which Flood replied:
"When I began to abuse you, you were a briefless barrister;
by abuse I made you counsel to the revenue,
by abuse I got you a silk gown, by abuse I made you
Solicitor-General, by abuse I may make you Chief Justice.
No, Scott, I'll praise you."</p>

<p>When Lord Clonmel was Lord Chief Justice he upheld
the undignified practice of demanding a shilling
for administering an oath, and used to be well satisfied,
provided the coin was a <i>good one</i>. In his time the
Birmingham shilling was current, and he used the following
extraordinary precautions to avoid being imposed
upon by taking a bad one. "You shall true answer
make to such questions as shall be demanded of
you touching this affidavit, so help you God! <i>Is this
a good shilling?</i> Are the contents of this affidavit true?
Is this your name and handwriting?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The family of Henn belonging to Clare have been,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>generation after generation, since the first of the name
became Chief Baron in 1679, connected with the Irish
Bench and Bar. William Henn, a descendant of the
Chief Baron, was made a Judge of the King's Bench in
1767, and when on Circuit at Wexford in 1789 two
young barristers contended before him with great zeal
and pertinacity, each flatly contradicting the other as
to the law of the case; and both at each turn of the
argument again and again referred with exemplary
confidence to the learned judge, as so well knowing
that what was said by him (the speaker) was right.
The judge said, "Well, gentlemen, can I settle this
matter between you? You, sir, say positively the law
is one way; and you, sir (turning to the opponent), as
unequivocally say it is the other way. I wish to God,
Billy Harris (leaning over and addressing the registrar
who sat beneath him), I knew what the law really
was!"&mdash;"My lord," replied Billy Harris, rising, and
turning round with great gravity and respect, "if I
possessed that knowledge, I assure your lordship that
I would tell your lordship with great pleasure!"&mdash;"Then,"
exclaimed the judge, "we'll save the point,
Billy Harris!"</p>

<p>Although more appropriate in the following chapter,
we may here introduce a story of the younger son of
the Judge Henn of the previous story. Jonathan, who
was more distinguished than his elder brother&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>other
Judge Henn&mdash;did not attain to the Bench. In early
years he was indifferent whether briefs were given him
or not, and indeed on one occasion he is said to have
sent a message to the Attorney-General, who had
called to engage him in a case, to keep "his d&mdash;d brief
and to take himself to the d&mdash;l." But later he became
very industrious, and his natural ability soon brought
him into a large and lucrative practice. He was counsel
for the Government at the trial of John Mitchell, and
at its close the wags of the Court declared that "Judge
Moore <i>spoke</i> to the evidence, but Jonathan Henn
<i>charged the jury</i>."</p>

<p>Chief Justice Carleton was a most lugubrious judge,
and was always complaining of something or other, but
chiefly about the state of his health, so that Curran remarked
that it was strange the old judge was <i>plaintive</i>
in every case tried before him.</p>

<p>One day his lordship came into Court very late,
looking very woeful. He apologised to the Bar for being
obliged to adjourn the Court at once and dismiss
the jury for that day. "Though," his lordship added,
"I am aware that an important issue stands for trial.
But, the fact is, gentlemen (addressing the Bar in a
low tone of voice and somewhat confidentially), I have
met with a domestic misfortune, which has altogether
deranged my nerves. Poor Lady Carleton has, most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>unfortunately, miscarried, and&mdash;." "Oh, then, my
lord," exclaimed Curran, "I am sure we are all quite
satisfied your lordship has done right in deciding
there is no <i>issue</i> to try to-day." His lordship smiled a
ghastly smile, and, retiring, thanked the Bar for their
sympathy.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Judge Foster was trying five prisoners for murder,
and misunderstood the drift of the evidence. Four of
the prisoners seem to have assisted, but a witness
said as to the fifth, Denis Halligan, that it was he
who gave the fatal blow: "My lord, I saw Denis Halligan
(that's in the dock there) take a vacancy (Irish
word for 'aim' at an unguarded part) at the poor soul
that's kilt, and give him a wipe with a <i>clehalpin</i> (Irish
word for 'bludgeon'), and lay him down as quiet as a
child." They were found guilty. The judge, sentencing
the first four, gave them seven years' imprisonment.
But when he came to Halligan, who really
killed the deceased, the judge said, "Denis Halligan,
I have purposely reserved the consideration of your
case to the last. Your crime is doubtless of a grievous
nature, yet I cannot avoid taking into consideration
the mitigating circumstances that attend it. By the
evidence of the witness it clearly appears that <i>you</i>
were the only one of the party who showed any mercy
to the unfortunate deceased. You took him to a vacant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>seat, and wiped him with a clean napkin, and you laid
him down with the gentleness one shows to a little
child. In consideration of these extenuating circumstances,
which reflect some credit upon you, I shall inflict
upon you three weeks' imprisonment." So Denis
Halligan got off by the judge mistaking a vacancy for a
vacant seat, and a <i>clehalpin</i> for a clean napkin.</p>

<p>John Toler (Lord Norbury) was Chief Justice of the
Common Pleas in Ireland. His humour was broad, and
his absolute indifference to propriety often saved the
situation by converting a serious matter into a wholly
ludicrous one. His Court was in constant uproar, owing
to his noisy jesting, and like a noted old Scottish
judge he would have his joke when the life of a human
being was hanging in the balance. Even on his own
deathbed he could not resist the impulse. On hearing
that his friend Lord Erne was also nearing his end at
the same time, he called for his valet: "James," said
Lord Norbury, "run round to Lord Erne and tell him
with my compliments that it will be a <i>dead</i>-heat between
us."</p>

<p>The best illustration of the almost daily condition
of things when Lord Norbury presided at Nisi Prius
is given by himself in his reply to the answer of a witness.
"What is your business?" asked the judge. "I
keep a <i>racquet-court</i>, my lord."&mdash;"So do I, so do I,"
immediately exclaimed the judge. Nor did he reserve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>his <i>bon mots</i> for Court merriment. Passing the Quay on
his way to the Four Courts one morning, he noticed a
crowd and inquired of a bystander the cause of it. On
being told that a tailor had just been rescued from attempted
suicide by drowning, his lordship exclaimed,
"What a fool to leave his <i>hot goose</i> for a <i>cold duck</i>."
The boastful statement of a gentleman in his company
that he had shot seventy hares before breakfast drew
from the Chief Justice the sarcastic remark, "I suppose,
sir, you fired at a wig."</p>

<p>A son of a peer having been accused of arson, of
which offence he was generally believed guilty, but acquitted
on a point of insufficiency of evidence to sustain
the indictment, was tried before Lord Norbury.
The young gentleman met the judge next at the Lord-Lieutenant's
levee in the Castle. Instead of avoiding
the Chief Justice, the scion of nobility boldly said, "I
have recently married, and have come here to enable
me to present my bride at the Drawing-Room."&mdash;"Quite
right to mind the Scripture. Better marry
than burn," retorted Lord Norbury.</p>

<p>A barrister once pressed him to non-suit the plaintiff
in a case; but his lordship decided to let it go to a
jury trial. "I do believe," said the disappointed advocate,
"your lordship has not the <i>courage to non-suit</i>."&mdash;"You
say, sir," replied the irate judge, "you don't
believe I'd have the courage to non-suit. I tell you I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>have courage to <i>shoot</i> and to <i>non-shoot</i>, but I'll not
non-suit for you." This same counsel was once horsewhipped
by an army officer at Nelson's Pillar in Sackville
Street, and applied for a Criminal Information
against his assailant. "Certainly he shall have it,"
said the witty judge. "The Court is bound to give
protection to any one who has <i>bled under the gallant
Nelson</i>."</p>

<p>On a motion before this judge, a sheriff's officer,
who had the hardihood to serve a process in Connemara,
where the king's writ <i>did not run</i>, swore that
the natives made him eat and swallow both copy and
original. Norbury, affecting great disgust, exclaimed:
"Jackson, Jackson, I hope it's not made returnable into
this Court."</p>

<p>While giving a judgment on a writ of right, Lord
Norbury observed that it was not sufficient for a demandant
to say he "claimed by descent." "Such an
answer," he continued, "would be a shrewd one for a
sweep, who got into your house by coming down the
chimney; and it would be an easy, as well as a sweeping,
way of getting in."</p>

<p>His lordship was attacked by a fit of gout when on
Circuit, and sent to the Solicitor-General requesting
the loan of a pair of large slippers. "Take them," said
the Solicitor to the servant, "with my respects, and I
hope soon to be in his lordship's shoes."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>At the instigation of O'Connell, Lord Norbury was
finally removed from the Bench. A flagrant case of
partiality was brought to Lord Brougham's notice
which exasperated Lord Norbury, and he is reported
to have said, "I'll resign to demand satisfaction. That
Scottish Broom wants to be made acquainted with an
Irish stick."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Two notorious highwaymen were charged before
Chief Baron O'Grady with robbery, and to the surprise
of all the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.
"Mr. Murphy," said the judge to the gaoler, "you will
greatly ease my mind by keeping these two respectable
gentlemen in custody until seven o'clock. I leave for
Dublin at five, and I should like to have at least two
hours' start of them." There is also the story of a barrister
who made an eloquent speech and got his client
off, but he was very anxious to know whether the prisoner
was guilty or not. "Well, sir," said the man when
applied to, "to tell the truth I thought I was guilty until
I heard you speak, and then I didn't see how I could
be." This at once recalls an old story. "Prisoner, I
understand you confess your guilt," said the judge.
"No, I don't," said the prisoner. "My counsel has convinced
me of my innocence."</p>

<p>On hearing that some spendthrift barristers, friends
of his, were appointed to be Commissioners of Insolv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>ent
Debtors the Chief Baron remarked, "At all events,
the insolvents can't complain of not being tried by
their peers." It was the same judge who caustically
observed, after a long and dull legal argument: "I
agree with my brother J&mdash;&mdash;, for the reasons given by
my brother M&mdash;&mdash;." A prisoner once was given a
practical specimen of his lordship's wit, and must have
been rather distressed by it. He was passing sentence
upon a pickpocket, and ordering a punishment common
at that time. "You will be whipped from North
Gate to South Gate," said the judge. "Bad luck to you,
you old blackguard," said the prisoner. "&mdash;And back
again," said the Chief Baron, as if he had been interrupted
in the delivery of the sentence.</p>

<p>A cause of much celebrity was tried at a county Assize,
at which Chief Baron O'Grady presided. Bushe,
then a K.C., who held a brief for the defence, was
pleading the cause of his client with much eloquence,
when a donkey in the courtyard outside set up a loud
bray. "One at a time, brother Bushe!" called out
his lordship. Peals of laughter filled the Court. The
counsel bore the interruption as best he could. The
judge was proceeding to sum up with his usual ability:
the donkey again began to bray. "I beg your lordship's
pardon," said Bushe, putting his hand to his
ear; "but there is such an echo in the Court that I can't
hear a word you say."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>In his charges to juries, O'Grady frequently made
some quaint remarks. There was a Kerry case in
which a number of men were indicted for riot and assault.
Several of them bore the familiar names of
O'Donoghue, Moriarty, Duggan, &amp;c., while among the
jurymen these names were also found. Well knowing
that consanguinity was prevalent in the district, the
judge began his address to the jury with the significant
remark: "Of course, gentlemen, you will acquit
your own relatives." In another case of larceny of
pantaloons which was clearly proved, but in which
the thief got a good character for honesty, he began:
"Gentlemen, the prisoner was an honest boy, but he
stole the pantaloons."</p>

<p>"I merely wish to address your lordship on the form
of the indictment, if your lordship pleases," said a
young barrister to the Chief Baron. "Oh, certainly, I
will hear you with mighty great pleasure, sir; but I'll
be after taking the verdict of the jury first," was the
sarcastic reply.</p>

<p>The brother of Chief Baron O'Grady once caught a
boy stealing turnips from one of his fields and asked
his lordship if the culprit could be prosecuted under
the Timber Acts. "No," said the Chief Baron, "unless
you can prove that your turnips are sticky."</p>

<p>Yelverton, first Baron Avonmore, possessed re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>markable
rhetorical ability and a highly cultivated
mind. He rose rapidly at the Bar, until he became Chief
Baron of Exchequer. He was the founder of the convivial
order of St. Patrick, called "The Monks of the
Screw," of which Curran, who wrote its charter song,
was Prior. Avonmore was a man of warm and benevolent
feelings, which he gave vent to in an equal degree
in private life, in the senate, and on the Bench.</p>

<p>Before giving an anecdote of Lord Avonmore it may
interest readers, especially English and Scottish, to
quote here the charter song of this famous Irish convivial
club of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The last two lines hit off the appearance of the Abbot,
a Mr. Doyle, and of the Prior, J. P. Curran. The
former was a big burly man with a fat, jovial face, while
Curran was a short and particularly spare man whose
"lean face" always attracted attention.</p>

<p>On a Lent Circuit, one of the Assize towns happened
to be a place, of which one of Lord Avonmore's
college contemporaries held a living: at his own request,
the Chief Baron's reverend friend preached the
Assize sermon. The time being the month of March
the weather was cold, the judge was chilled, and unhappily
the sermon was long, and the preacher tedious.
After the discourse was over, the preacher descended
from the pulpit and approached the judge, smirking
and smiling, looking fully satisfied with his own exertions,
and expecting to receive the compliments and
congratulations of his quondam chum. "Well, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>lord," he asked, "and how did you like the sermon?"&mdash;"Oh!
most wonderfully," replied Avonmore. "It was
like the peace of God&mdash;it passed all understanding;
and&mdash;like his mercy&mdash;I thought it would have endured
for ever."</p>

<p>When Plunket was at the Bar his great friend and
rival was C. K. Bushe. The former was Attorney-General
at the same time as the latter was Solicitor-General,
and it caused him much dissatisfaction when
Plunket learned that on a change of Government
Solicitor-General Bushe had not followed his example
and resigned office. At the time this occurred both
barristers happened to be engaged in a case at which,
when it was called, Bushe only appeared. On the judge
inquiring of Mr. Bushe if he knew the reason of Mr.
Plunket's absence his friend jocosely remarked, "I
suppose, my lord, he is Cabinet-making." This pleasantry,
at his expense, was told to Plunket by a friend,
when he arrived in Court, on which, turning to the
judge, the ex-Attorney-General proudly said, "I assure
your lordship I am not so well qualified for Cabinet-making
as my learned friend. I never was either a
<i>turner</i> or a <i>joiner</i>."</p>

<p>Two eminent Irish astronomers differed in an argument
on the parallax of a lyr&aelig;&mdash;the one maintaining
that it was three seconds, and the other that it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>only two seconds. On being told of this discussion,
and that the astronomers parted without arriving at
an agreement, Plunket quietly remarked: "It must
be a very serious quarrel indeed, when even the seconds
cannot agree."</p>

<p>Once applying the common expression to accommodation
bills of exchange, that they were <i>mere kites</i>,
the judge, an English Chancellor, said "he never heard
that expression applied before to any but the kites of
boys."&mdash;"Oh," replied Plunket, "that's the difference
between kites in England and in Ireland. In England
the wind raises the kite, but in Ireland the kite raises
the wind."</p>

<p>Everybody (says Phillips) knew how acutely Plunket
felt his forced resignation of the chancellorship,
and his being superseded by Lord Campbell. A violent
storm arose on the day of Campbell's expected arrival,
and a friend remarking to Plunket how sick of his promotion
the passage must have made the new Chancellor:
"Yes," said the former, ruefully, "but it won't
make him throw up the seals."</p>

<p>Mr. Frankfort Moore, in his <i>Journalist's Notebook</i>,

a man who was charged with stealing a pig. The evidence
of the theft was quite conclusive, and, in fact,
was not combated; but the prisoner called the priests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>and neighbours to attest to his good character. "Gentlemen
of the jury," said the judge, "I think that the

stolen by the prisoner, and that he is the most amiable
man in the country."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR<br />
THE BARRISTERS OF IRELAND</h2>


<p>The Irish counsel like the occupants
of the Bench were, in early times, eminent for their jolly
carousing. Once, about 1687, a heavy argument coming
on before Lord Chancellor Fitton, Mr. Nagle, the solicitor,
retained Sir Toby Butler as counsel, who entered
into a bargain that he would not drink a drop of wine
while the case was at hearing. This bargain reached
the ears of the Chancellor, who asked Sir Toby if it was
true that such a compact had been made. The counsel
said it was true, and the bargain had been rigidly
kept; but on further inquiry he admitted that as he had
only promised not to <i>drink</i> a <i>drop</i> of wine, he felt he
must have some stimulant. So he got a basin, into
which he poured two bottles of claret, and then got
two hot rolls of bread, sopped them in the claret and
ate them. "I see," replied the Chancellor; "in truth,
Sir Toby, you deserve to be master of the rolls!"</p>

<span class="caption">JOHN P. CURRAN, MASTER OF ROLLS.</span>
</div>

<p>One naturally turns to Curran for a selection of the
witty sayings of the Irish Bar, and abundantly he supplies
them, although in these days many of his jests
may be considered as in somewhat doubtful taste.
Phillips tells us he remembered Curran once&mdash;in an
action for breach of promise of marriage, in which he
was counsel for the defendant, a young clergyman&mdash;thus
appealing to the jury: "Gentlemen, I entreat you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>not to ruin this young man by a vindictive verdict;
for <i>though</i> he has talents, and is in the Church, <i>he may
rise</i>!"</p>

<p>After his college career Curran went to London
to study for the Bar. His circumstances were often
straitened, and at times so much so that he had to
pass the day without dinner. But under such depressing
circumstances his high spirits never forsook him.
One day he was sitting in St. James's Park merrily
whistling a tune when a gentleman passed, who, struck
by the youth's melancholy appearance while, at the
same time, he whistled a lively air, asked how he
"came to be sitting there whistling while other people
were at dinner." Curran replied, "I would have been
at dinner too, but a trifling circumstance&mdash;delay in remittances&mdash;obliges
me to dine on an Irish tune." The
result was that Curran was invited to dine with the
stranger, and years afterwards, when he had become
famous, he recalled the incident to his entertainer&mdash;Macklin,
the celebrated actor&mdash;with the assurance,
"You never acted better in your life."</p>

<p>From Phillips again we have Curran's retort upon
an Irish judge, who was quite as remarkable for his
good humour and raillery as for his legal researches.
Curran was addressing a jury on one of the State trials
in 1803 with his usual animation. The judge, whose
political bias, if any judge can have one, was certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>supposed not to be favourable to the prisoner, shook
his head in doubt or denial of one of the advocate's
arguments. "I see, gentlemen," said Curran, "I see
the motion of his lordship's head; common observers
might imagine that implied a difference of opinion, but
they would be mistaken; it is merely accidental. Believe
me, gentlemen, if you remain here many days, you
will yourselves perceive that when his lordship shakes
his head, there's <i>nothing in it</i>!"</p>

<p>Curran was one day engaged in a case in which he
had for a junior a remarkably tall and slender gentleman,
who had been originally intended to take orders.
The judge observing that the case under discussion
involved a question of ecclesiastical law, Curran interposed
with: "I refer your lordship to a high authority
behind me, who was once intended for the Church,
though in my opinion he was fitter for the steeple."</p>

<p>He was one day walking with a friend, who, hearing
a person say "curosity" for "curiosity," exclaimed:
"How that man murders the English language!"&mdash;"Not
so bad as that," replied Curran. "He has only knocked
an 'i' out."</p>

<p>Curran never joined the hunt, except once, not far
from Dublin. His horse joined very keenly in the sport,
but the horseman was inwardly hoping all the while
that the dogs would not find. In the midst of his career,
the hounds broke into a potato field of a wealthy land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>-agent,
who happened to have been severely cross-examined
by Curran some days before. The fellow came
up patronisingly and said, "Oh sure, you are Counsellor
Curran, the great lawyer. Now then, Mr. Lawyer,
can you tell me by what law you are trespassing
on my ground?"&mdash;"By what law, did you ask, Mr.
Maloney?" replied Curran. "It must be the <i>Lex Tally-ho-nis</i>,
to be sure."</p>

<p>During one of the Circuits, Curran was dining with
a brother advocate at a small inn kept by a worthy
woman known by the Christian name of Honoria, or,
as it is generally called, Honor. The gentlemen were
so pleased with their entertainment that they summoned
Honor to receive their compliments and drink
a glass of wine with them. She attended at once, and
Curran after a brief eulogium on the dinner filled a
glass, and handing it to the landlady proposed as a
toast "Honor and Honesty," to which the lady with
an arch smile added, "Our absent friends," drank off
her amended toast and withdrew.</p>

<p>He happened one day to have for his companion in
a stage-coach a very vulgar and revolting old woman,
who seemed to have been encrusted with a prejudice
against Ireland and all its inhabitants. Curran sat
chafing in silence in his corner. At last, suddenly, a
number of cows, with their tails and heads in the air,
kept rushing up and down the road in alarming prox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>imity
to the coach windows. The old woman manifestly
was but ill at ease. At last, unable to restrain her terror,
she faltered out, "Oh dear; oh dear, sir! what can the
cows mean?"&mdash;"Faith, my good woman," replied Curran,
"as there's an Irishman in the coach, I shouldn't
wonder if they were on the outlook for <i>a bull</i>!"</p>

<p>Curran was once asked what an Irish gentleman,
just arrived in England, could mean by perpetually
putting out his tongue. "I suppose," replied the wit,
"he's trying <i>to catch the English accent</i>."</p>

<p>During the temporary separation of Lord Avonmore
and Curran, Egan espoused the judge's imaginary
quarrel so bitterly that a duel was the consequence.
The parties met, and on the ground Egan complained
that the disparity in their sizes gave his antagonist a
manifest advantage. "I might as well fire at a razor's
edge as at him," said Egan, "and he may hit me as
easily as a turf-stack."&mdash;"I'll tell you what, Mr. Egan,"
replied Curran; "I wish to take no advantage of you&mdash;let
my <i>size</i> be <i>chalked</i> out upon your side, and I am
quite content that every shot which hits outside that
mark should <i>go for nothing</i>." And in another duel, in
which his opponent was a major who had taken
offence at some remark the eminent counsel had made
about him in Court, the major asked Curran to fire
first. "No," replied Curran, "I am here on your invitation,
so you must <i>open the ball</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir Thomas Furton, who was a respectable speaker,
but certainly nothing more, affected once to discuss the
subject of eloquence with Curran, assuming an equality
by no means palatable to the latter. Curran happening
to mention, as a peculiarity of his, that he could
not speak above a quarter of an hour without requiring
something to moisten his lips, Sir Thomas, pursuing
his comparisons, declared <i>he</i> had the advantage
in that respect. "I spoke," said he, "the other night in
the Commons for five hours on the Nabob of Oude,
and never felt in the least thirsty."&mdash;"It is very remarkable,
indeed," replied Curran, "for everyone agrees
that was the <i>driest</i> speech of the session."</p>

<p>Lord Clare (says Mr. Hayward) had a favourite dog
which was permitted to follow him to the Bench. One
day, during an argument of Curran's, the Chancellor
turned aside and began to fondle the dog, with the
obvious view of intimating inattention or disregard.
The counsel stopped; the judge looked up: "I beg your
pardon," continued Curran, "I thought your lordship
had been in consultation."</p>

<p>Curran often raised a laugh at Lord Norbury's expense.
The laws, at that period, made capital punishment
so general that nearly all crimes were punishable
with death by the rope. It was remarked Lord Norbury
never hesitated to condemn the convicted prisoner
to the gallows. Dining in company with Curran,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>who was carving some corned beef, Lord Norbury inquired,
"Is that hung beef, Mr. Curran?"&mdash;"Not yet,
my lord," was the reply; "you have not <i>tried</i> it."</p>

<p>"A doldrum, Mr. Curran! What does the witness
mean by saying you put him in a doldrum?" asked
Lord Avonmore. "Oh, my lord, it is a very common
complaint with persons of this description; it's merely
a confusion of the head arising from a corruption of
the heart."</p>

<p>Angered one day in debate, he put his hand on his
heart, saying, "I am the trusty guardian of my own
honour."&mdash;"Then," replied Sir Boyle Roche, "I congratulate
my honourable friend in the snug little sinecure
to which he has appointed himself."</p>

<p>But on one occasion he met his match in a pert,
jolly, keen-eyed son of Erin, who was up as a witness
in a case of dispute in the matter of a horse deal. Curran
was anxious to break down the credibility of this
witness, and thought to do it by making the man contradict
himself&mdash;by tangling him up in a network of
adroitly framed questions&mdash;but to no avail. The ostler's
good common sense, and his equanimity and good
nature, were not to be upset. Presently, Curran, in a
towering rage, thundered forth, as no other counsel
would have dared to do in the presence of the Court:
"Sir, you are incorrigible! The truth is not to be got
from you, for it is not in you. I see the villain in your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>face!"&mdash;"Faith, yer honour," replied the witness, with
the utmost simplicity of truth and honesty, "my face
must be moighty clane and shinin' indade, if it can reflect
like that." For once in his life the great barrister
was floored by a simple witness. He could not recover
from that repartee, and the case went against him.</p>

<p>When Curran heard that there was a likelihood of
trouble for the part he took in 1798, and that in all
probability he would be deprived of the rank of Q.C.,
he remarked: "They may take away the <i>silk</i>, but they
leave the <i>stuff</i> behind."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Bully" Egan had a great muscular figure, as may be
guessed from the story of the duel with Curran. To
his bulk he added a stentorian voice, which he freely
used in Nisi Prius practice to browbeat opposing
counsel and witnesses, and through which he acquired
his <i>sobriquet</i>. On one occasion his opponent was a
dark-visaged barrister who had made out a good case
for his client. Egan, in the course of an eloquent address,
begged the jury not to be carried away by the
"dark oblivion of a brow."&mdash;"What do you mean by
using such balderdash?" said a friend. "It may be
balderdash," replied Egan, "but depend upon it, it
will do very well for that jury." On another occasion
he concluded a vituperative address by describing the
defendant as "a most naufrageous ruffian."&mdash;"What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>sort of a ruffian is that?" whispered his junior. "I have
no idea," responded Egan, "but I think <i>it sounds well</i>."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>H. D. Grady was a strong supporter, in the Irish
Parliament, of the Union of Great Britain and Ireland,
although he represented a constituency strongly opposed
to it; and he did not conceal the fact that the
Government had made it worth his while to support
them. "What!" exclaimed one of his constituents
who remonstrated with him; "do you mean to sell your
country?"&mdash;"Thank God," cried this patriot, "I have
a country to sell."</p>

<p>For his Court work this anti-Nationalist barrister
had what he called his "jury-eye." When he wanted
a jury to note a particular point he kept winking his
right eye at them. Entering the Court one day looking
very depressed, a sympathetic friend asked if he was
quite well, adding, "You are not so lively as usual."&mdash;"How
can I be," replied Grady, "my jury-eye is out of
order."</p>

<p>He was examining a foreign sailor at Cork Assizes.
"You are a Swede, I believe?"&mdash;"No, I am not."&mdash;"What
are you then?"&mdash;"I am a Dane." Grady turned
to the jury, "Gentlemen, you hear the equivocating
scoundrel. <i>Go down, sir!</i>"</p>

<p>Judge Boyd who, according to O'Connell, was guilty
of sipping his wine through a peculiarly made tube
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>from a metal inkstand, to which we have already referred,
one day presided at a trial where a witness was
charged with being intoxicated at the time he was
speaking about. Mr. Harry Grady laboured hard to
show that the man had been sober. Judge Boyd at
once interposed and said: "Come now, my good man,
it is a very important consideration; tell the Court
truly, were you drunk or were you sober upon that
occasion?"&mdash;"Oh, quite sober, my Lord." Grady added,
with a significant look at the <i>inkstand</i>, "As sober
as a judge!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Mr. Bethell, a barrister at the time of the Union of
Ireland and Great Britain, like many of his brethren,
published a pamphlet on that much-vexed subject. Mr.
Lysaght, meeting him, said: "Bethell, you never told
me you had published a pamphlet on the Union. The
one I saw contained some of the best things I have
ever seen in any of these publications."&mdash;"I am proud
you think so," rejoined the other eagerly. "Pray what
was the thing that pleased you so much?"&mdash;"Well,"
replied Lysaght, "as I passed a pastry-cook's shop this
morning, I saw a girl come out with three hot mince-pies
wrapped up in one of your productions!"</p>

<p>"Pleasant Ned Lysaght," as his familiar friends
called him, meeting a Dublin banker one day offered
himself as an assistant if there was a vacancy in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>bank's staff. "You, my dear Lysaght," said the banker;
"what position could you fill?"&mdash;"Two," was the reply.
"If you made me <i>cashier</i> for one day, I'll become
<i>runner</i> the next."</p>

<p>And it was Lysaght who made a neat pun on his
host's name at a dinner party during the Munster Circuit.
The gentleman, named Flatly, was in the habit
of inviting members of the Bar to his house when the
Court was held in Limerick. One evening the conversation
turned upon matrimony, and surprise was expressed
that their host still remained a bachelor. He
confessed that he never had had the courage to propose
to a young lady. "Depend upon it," said Lysaght,
"if you ask any girl <i>boldly</i> she will not refuse you,
<i>Flatly</i>."</p>

<p>O'Flanagan, author of <i>The Lord Chancellors of Ireland</i>,
writes of Holmes, an Irish barrister: "He made
us laugh very much one day in the Queen's Bench.
I was waiting for some case in which I was counsel,
when the crier called, 'Pluck and Diggers,' and in came
James Scott, Q.C., very red and heated, and, throwing
his bag on the table within the bar, he said, 'My lords,
I beg to assure your lordships I feel so exhausted I am
quite unable to argue this case. I have been speaking
for three hours in the Court of Exchequer, and I am
quite tired; and pray excuse me, my lords, I must get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>some refreshment.' The Chief Justice bowed, and said,
'Certainly, Mr. Scott.' So that gentleman left the
Court. 'Mr. Holmes, you are in this case,' said the
Chief Justice; 'we'll be happy to hear you.'&mdash;'Really,
my lord, I am very tired too,' said Mr. Holmes. 'Surely,'
said the Chief Justice, 'you have not been speaking
for three hours in the Court of Exchequer? What
has tired you?'&mdash;'Listening to Mr. Scott,' was Holmes'
sarcastic reply."</p>

<p>Although rivals in their profession, C. K. Bushe
had a great admiration for Plunket's abilities, and
would not listen to any disparagement of them. One
day while Plunket was speaking at the Bar a friend
said to Bushe, "Well, if it was not for the eloquence,
I'd as soon listen to &mdash;&mdash;," who was a very prosy
speaker. "No doubt," replied Bushe, "just as the Connaught
man said, ''Pon my conscience if it was not for
the malt and the hops, I'd as soon drink ditch water as
porter.'"</p>

<p>There is an impromptu of Bushe's upon two political
agitators of the day who had declined an appeal to
arms, one on account of his wife, the other from the
affection in which he held his daughter:</p>

<span class="i0">That 'their' days might be long in 'the land.'"<br /></span>

<p>A young barrister once tried to raise a laugh at the
Mess dinner at the expense of "Jerry Keller," a barrister
who was prominent in social circles of Dublin,
and whose cousin, a wine merchant, held the contract
for supplying wine to the Mess cellar. "I have noticed,"
said the junior, "that the claret bottles are
growing smaller and smaller at each Assizes since
your cousin became our wine merchant."&mdash;"Whist!"
replied Jerry; "don't you be talking of what you know
nothing about. It's quite natural the bottles should be
growing smaller, because we all know <i>they shrink in
the washing</i>."</p>

<p>An ingenious expedient was devised to save a prisoner
charged with robbery in the Criminal Court at
Dublin. The principal thing that appeared in evidence
against him was a confession, alleged to have been
made by him at the police office. The document, purporting
to contain this self-criminating acknowledgment,
was produced by the officer, and the following
passage was read from it:</p>

<div class="poetryblock">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mangan said he never robbed but twice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said it was Crawford."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This, it will be observed, has no mark of the writer
having any notion of punctuation, but the meaning attached
to it was, that</p>

<div class="poetryblock">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mangan said he never robbed but twice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Said it was Crawford.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. O'Gorman, the counsel for the prisoner, begged
to look at the paper. He perused it, and rather astonished
the peace officer by asserting, that so far from
its proving the man's guilt, it clearly established his
innocence. "This," said the learned gentleman, "is the
fair and obvious reading of the sentence:</p>

<div class="poetryblock">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mangan said he never robbed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But twice said it was Crawford</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This interpretation had its effect on the jury, and
the man was acquitted.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There were two barristers at the Irish Bar who
formed a singular contrast in their stature&mdash;Ninian
Mahaffy was as much above the middle size as Mr.
Collis was below it. When Lord Redsdale was Lord
Chancellor of Ireland these two gentlemen chanced
to be retained in the same cause a short time after his
lordship's elevation, and before he was personally acquainted
with the Irish Bar. Mr. Collis was opening
the motion, when the Lord Chancellor observed, "Mr.
Collis, when a barrister addresses the Court, he must
stand."&mdash;"I am standing on the bench, my lord," said
Collis. "I beg a thousand pardons," said his lordship,
somewhat confused. "Sit down, Mr. Mahaffy."&mdash;"I
am sitting, my lord," was the reply to the confounded
Chancellor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>A barrister who was present on this occasion made
it the subject of the following epigram:</p>

<div class="poetryblock">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mahaffy and Collis, ill-paired in a case,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Representatives true of the rattling size ace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the heights of the law, though I hope you will rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will never be judges I'm sure of a(s)size."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A very able barrister, named Collins, had the reputation
of occasionally involving his adversary in a legal
net, and, by his superior subtlety, gaining his cause.
On appearing in Court in a case with the eminent barrister,
Mr. Pigot, Q.C., there arose a question as to who
should be leader, Mr. Collins being the senior in standing
at the Bar, Mr. Pigot being one of the Queen's
Counsel. "I yield," said Mr. Collins; "my friend holds
the honours."&mdash;"Faith, if he does, Stephen," observed
Mr. Herrick, "'tis you have all the tricks."</p>

<p>It is told by one of O'Connell's biographers that he
never prepared his addresses to judges or juries&mdash;he
trusted to the inspiration of the moment. He had at
command humour and pathos, invective and argument;
he was quick-witted and astonishingly ready in repartee,
and he brought all these into play, as he found them
serviceable in influencing the bench or the jury-box.</p>

<p>Lord Manners, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, stopped
several of the many counsels in a Chancery suit by saying
he had made up his mind. He, in fact, lost his tem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>per
as each in succession rose, and he declined them
in turn. At last O'Connell, one of the unheard counsel,
began in his deepest and most emphatic tone: "Well
then, my lord, since your lordship refuses to hear my
learned friend, you will be pleased to hear <span class="smcap">ME</span>"; and
then he plunged into the case, without waiting for any
expression, assent or dissent, or allowing any interruption.
On he went, discussing and distinguishing,
and commenting and quoting, till he secured the attention
of, and evidently was making an impression on,
the unwilling judge. Every few minutes O'Connell
would say: "Now, my lord, my learned young friend
beside me, had your lordship heard him, would have
informed your lordship in a more impressive and lucid
manner than I can hope to do," etcetera, until he finished
a masterly address. The Lord Chancellor next
morning gave judgment in favour of O'Connell's client.</p>

<p>He was engaged in a will case, the allegation being
that the will was a forgery. The subscribing witness
swore that the will had been signed by the deceased
"while life was in him"&mdash;that being an expression derived
from the Irish language, which peasants who
have long ceased to speak Irish still retain. The evidence
was strong in favour of the will, when O'Connell
was struck by the persistency of the man, who always
repeated the same words, "The life was in him."
O'Connell asked: "On the virtue of your oath, was he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>alive?"&mdash;"By the virtue of my oath, the life was in
him."&mdash;"Now I call upon you in the presence of your
Maker, who will one day pass sentence on you for this
evidence, I solemnly ask&mdash;and answer me at your
peril&mdash;was there not a live fly in the dead man's
mouth when his hand was placed on the will?" The
witness was taken aback at this question; he trembled,
turned pale, and faltered out an abject confession that
the counsellor was right; a fly had been introduced into
the mouth of the dead man, to allow the witness to
swear that "life was in him."</p>

<p>O'Connell was defending John Connor on a charge
of murder. The most incriminating evidence was the
finding of the murderer's hat, left behind on the road.
The all-important question was as to the identity of the
hat as that of the accused man. A constable was prepared
to swear to it. "You found this hat?" said O'Connell.
"Yes."&mdash;"You examined it?"&mdash;"Yes."&mdash;"You
know it to be the prisoner's property?"&mdash;"Yes."&mdash;"When
you picked it up you saw it was damaged?"&mdash;"Yes."&mdash;"And
looking inside you saw the prisoner's
name, <span class="smcap">J-o-h-n C-o-n-n-o-r</span>?" (here he spelt out the
name slowly). "Yes," was the answer. "There is no
name inside at all, my lord," said O'Connell, and the
prisoner was saved.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Explaining to a judge his absence from the Civil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>Court at the time a case was heard, in which he should
have appeared as counsel, O'Connell said he could
not leave a client in the Criminal Court until the verdict
was given. "What was it?" inquired the judge.
"Acquitted," responded O'Connell. "Then you have
got off a wretch who is not fit to live," said the judge.
O'Connell, knowing his lordship to be a very religious
man, at once replied: "I am sure you will agree with
me that a man whom you regard as not fit to <i>live</i>
would be still more <i>unfit</i> to die."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There was a young barrister&mdash;a contemporary of
O'Connell&mdash;named Parsons, who had a good deal of
humour, and who hated the whole tribe of attorneys.
Perhaps they had not treated him very well, but his
prejudice against them was very constant and conspicuous.
One day, in the Hall of the Four Courts,
an attorney came up to him to beg a subscription towards
burying a brother attorney who had died in distressed
circumstances. Parsons took out a one-pound
note and tendered it. "Oh, Mr. Parsons," said the applicant,
"I do not want so much&mdash;I only ask a shilling
from each contributor. I have limited myself to that,
and I cannot really take more."&mdash;"Oh, take it, take it,"
said Parsons; "for God's sake, my good sir, take the
pound, and while you are at it bury twenty of them."</p>

<p>There is a terseness in the following which seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>be inimitable. Lord Norbury was travelling with Parsons;
they passed a gibbet. "Parsons," said Norbury,
with a chuckle, "where would <i>you</i> be now if every
one had his due?"&mdash;"Alone in my carriage," replied
Parsons.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Here is a young Irishman's first Bar-speech. "Your
lordships perceive that we stand here as our grandmothers'
administrators <i>de bonis non</i>; and really, my
lords, it does strike me that it would be a monstrous
thing to say that a party can now come in, in the very
teeth of an Act of Parliament, and actually turn us
round, under colour of hanging us up, on the foot of a
contract made behind our backs."</p>

<p>A learned Serjeant MacMahon was noted for his
confusion of language in his efforts to be sublime. He
cared less for the sense than the sound. As, for example:
"Gentlemen of the jury, I smell a rat&mdash;but I'll nip
it in the bud." And, "My client acted boldly. He saw
the storm brewing in the distance, but he was not dismayed!
He took the bull by the horns and he <i>indicted
him for perjury</i>."</p>

<p>Peter Burrowes, a well-known member of the Irish
Bar, was on one occasion counsel for the prosecution
at an important trial for murder. Burrowes had a severe
cold, and opened his speech with a box of lozenges
in one hand and in the other the small pistol bullet by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>which the man had met his death. Between the pauses
of his address he kept supplying himself with a lozenge.
But at last, in the very middle of a 'high-falutin'
period, he stopped. His legal chest heaved, his eyes
seemed starting from his head, and in a voice tremulous
with fright he exclaimed: "Oh! h-h!!! Gentlemen, gentlemen;
I've swallowed the bul-let!"</p>

<p>An Irish counsel who was once asked by the judge
for whom he was "concerned," replied: "My lord, I am
retained by the defendant, and therefore I am concerned
for the plaintiff."</p>

<p>A junior at the Bar in course of his speech began
to use a simile of "the eagle soaring high above the
mists of the earth, winning its daring flight against a
midday sun till the contemplation becomes too dazzling
for humanity, and mortal eyes gaze after it in
vain." Here the orator was noticed to falter and lose
the thread of his speech, and sat down after some vain
attempts to regain it; the judge remarking: "The next
time, sir, you bring an eagle into Court, I should recommend
you to clip its wings."</p>

<p>Mr. Tim Healy's power of effective and stinging repartee
is probably unexcelled. He is seldom at a loss
for a retort, and there are not a few politicians and
others who regret having been foolish enough to rouse
his resentment. There is on record, however, an amusing
interlude in the passing of which Tim was discom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>fited&mdash;crushed,
and found himself unable to "rise to
the occasion."</p>

<p>During the hearing of a case at the Recorder's Court
in Dublin the Testament on which the witnesses were
being sworn disappeared. After a lengthy hunt for it,
counsel for the defendant noticed that Mr. Healy had
taken possession of the book, and was deeply absorbed
in its contents, and quite unconscious of the dismay its
disappearance was causing.</p>

<p>"I think, sir," said the counsel, addressing the Recorder,
"that Mr. Healy has the Testament." Hearing
his name mentioned, Mr. Healy looked up, realised
what had occurred, and, with apologies, handed it over.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," added the counsel, "Mr. Healy was
so interested that he did not know of our loss. He took
it for a new publication." For once Mr. Healy's nimble
wit failed him, and forced him to submit to the humiliation
of being scored off.</p>

<p>In the North of Ireland the peasantry pronounce the
word witness "wetness." At Derry Assizes a man
said he had brought his "wetness" with him to corroborate
his evidence. "Bless me," said the judge, "about
what age are you?"&mdash;"Forty-two my last birthday, my
lord," replied the witness. "Do you mean to tell the
jury," said the judge, "that at your age you still have a
wet nurse?"&mdash;"Of course I have, my lord." Counsel
hereupon interposed and explained.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p>The witness who gave the following valuable testimony,
however, was probably keeping strictly to fact.
"I sees Phelim on the top of the wall. 'Paddy,' he says.
'What,' says I. 'Here,' says he. 'Where?' says I.
'Hush,' says he. 'Whist,' says I. And that's all."</p>

<p>The wit of the Irish Bar seems to infect even the officers
of the Courts and the people who enter the witness-box.
It is impossible, for example, not to admire
the fine irony of the usher who, when he was told to
clear the Court, called out: "All ye blaggards that are
not lawyers lave the building."</p>

<p>Irish judges have much greater difficulties to contend
against, because the people with whom they have
to deal have a fund of ready retort. "Sir," said an exasperated
Irish judge to a witness who refused to answer
the questions put to him&mdash;"sir, this is a contempt
of Court."&mdash;"I know it, my lord, but I was endeavouring
to concale it," was the irresistible reply.</p>

<p>A certain Irish attorney threatening to prosecute a
printer for inserting in his paper the death of a person
still living, informed him that "No person should publish
a death unless informed of the fact by the party
deceased."</p>

<p>A rather amusing story is told of a trial where one of
the Irish jurymen had been "got at" and bribed to secure
the jury agreeing to a verdict of "Manslaughter,"
however much they might want to return one upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>capital charge of "Murder." The jury were out for several
hours, and it was believed that eventually the result
would be that they would not agree upon a verdict
at all. However, close upon midnight, they were starved
into one, and it was that of "Manslaughter." Next day
the particular juryman concerned received his promised
reward, and in paying it, the man who had arranged
it for him remarked: "I suppose you had a great deal of
difficulty in getting the other jurymen to agree to a
verdict of 'Manslaughter'?"&mdash;"I should just think I
did," replied the man. "I had to knock it into them, for
all the others&mdash;the whole eleven of them&mdash;wanted to
acquit him."</p>

<p>An Irish lawyer addressed the Court as <i>Gentlemen</i>
instead of <i>Your Honours</i>. When he had concluded, a
brother lawyer pointed out his error. He immediately
rose and apologised thus: "In the heat of the debate I
called your honours gentlemen,&mdash;I made a mistake,
your honours."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE<br />
THE JUDGES OF SCOTLAND</h2>




<p>From the Institution of the Court
of Session by James V of Scotland till well into the
nineteenth century, it was the custom of Scottish judges
when taking their seat on the Bench to assume a title
from an estate&mdash;it might even be from a farm&mdash;already
in their own or their family's possession. So we find
that nearly every parish in Scotland has given birth to
a judge who by this practice has made that parish or
an estate in it more or less familiar to Scottish ears.
Monboddo, near Fordoun, in Kincardineshire, at once
recalls the judge who gave "attic suppers" in his
house in St. John Street, Edinburgh, and held a theory
that all infants were born with tails like monkeys; but
under the modern practice of simply adding "Lord"
to his surname of Burnet, we doubt if his eccentric
personality would be so readily remembered. Lord
Dirleton's <i>Doubts</i>, Lord Fountainhall's <i>Historical
Observes</i>, carry a more imposing sound in their titles
than if those one-time indispensable works of reference
had been simply named Nisbet on Legal Doubts,
and Lauder on Historical Observations of Memorable
Events.</p>

<p>The selection of a title was an important matter with
these old judges. When Lauder was raised to the
Bench, his estate to the south-east of Edinburgh was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>called Woodhead; but it would never have done for
a Senator of the College of Justice to be known as
"Lord Woodhead," so the name of the estate was
changed to Fountainhall, and as Lord Fountainhall he
took his seat among "the Fifteen" as the full Bench
of judges was then termed.</p>

<p>These old-time judges with their rugged ferocity,
corruption, and occasionally brave words and deeds,
in a great measure present to us now a miniature history
of Scotland in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. "Show me the man, and I will show you the
law," one is reported to have said, meaning that the
litigant with the longest purse was pretty certain to
win his case in the long run. They delighted in long
arguments, and highly appreciated bewilderment in
pleadings; "Dinna be brief," cried one judge when an
advocate modestly asked to be briefly heard in a case
in which he appeared as junior counsel. But the tendency
to delay cases in the old Courts stretched beyond
all reasonable lengths and became a scandal to the
country. It was not a question of a month or even a
year. Years passed and still cases remained undecided,
some even were passed on from one generation
to another&mdash;a litigant by his will handing on his plea
in the Court to his successor along with his estate.
This protracted delay in deciding causes formed the
subject of that highly amusing and characteristic skit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>on the Scottish judges for which Boswell was largely

<p><br />It was the first Lord Meadowbank, who wearying of
the dry statement of a case made by Mr. Thomas W.
Blair, broke in with the remark: "Declaim, sir! why
don't you declaim? Speak to me as if I were a popular
assembly."</p>

<p>In the reign of Queen Anne there was an old Scottish
judge&mdash;Lord Dun&mdash;who was particularly distinguished
for his piety. Thomas Coutts, the founder of
the bank now so well known, used to relate of him that
when a difficult case came before him, as Lord Ordinary,
he used to say, "Eh, Lord, what am I to do? Eh,
sirs, I wish you would make it up!" Of another judge
of much the same period, also noted for his strict observance
of religious ordinances; but who, at the same
time, did not allow these to interfere with his social
habits, it is related that every Saturday evening he had
with him his niece, who afterwards married a more
famous Scottish judge, Andrew Fletcher, Lord Milton,
Charles Ross who made himself prominent in the "45"
Rebellion, and David Reid, his clerk. The judge had
what was, and in some parts of Scotland still is, known
as "the exercise," which consisted of the reading of a
chapter from the Bible, and his form of announcing the
evening devotions was: "Betsy (his niece), ye hae a
sweet voice, lift ye up a psalm; Charles, ye hae a gey
strong voice, read the chapter; and David, fire ye the
plate." Firing the plate consisted of a dish of brandy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>prepared for the company, of which David took charge,
and while the first part of the proceedings were in
progress David lighted the brandy, which when he
thought it burnt to his master's taste he blew out, and
this was the signal for the others to stop, while the
whole company partook of the burnt brandy. This same
judge&mdash;Lord Forglen&mdash;was walking one day with Lord
Newhall, in the latter's grounds. Lord Newhall was
a grave and austere man, while, as may be gathered,
Lord Forglen was a medley of curious elements. As
they passed a picturesque bend of a river Lord Forglen
exclaimed: "Now, my lord, this is a fine walk. If
ye want to pray to God, can there be a better place?
If ye want to kiss a bonny lass, can there be a better
place?"</p>

<span class="caption">SIR DAVID RAE, LORD ESKGROVE.</span>
</div>

<p>Sir David Rae (Lord Eskgrove), Lord Justice-Clerk
of Scotland, has been described as a ludicrous person
about whom people seemed to have nothing else to do
but tell stories. Sir Walter Scott imitated perfectly
his slow manner of speech and peculiar pronunciation,
which always put an accent on the last syllable of a
word, and the letter "g" when at the end of a word got
its full value. When a knot of young advocates was
seen standing round the fireplace of the Parliament
Hall listening to a low muttering voice, and the party
suddenly broke up in roars of laughter, it was pretty
certain to be a select company to whom Sir Walter had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>been retailing one of the latest stories of Lord Eskgrove.</p>

<p>He was a man of much self-importance, which comes
out in his remarks to a young lady of great beauty who
was called as a witness in the trial of Glengarry for
murder. "Young woman, you will now consider yourself
as in the presence of Almighty God, and of this
Court; lift up your veil, throw off all modesty, and look
<i>me</i> in the face."</p>

<p>Sir John Henderson of Fordell, a zealous Whig, had
long nauseated the Scottish Civil Courts by his burgh
politics. Their lordships of the Bench had once to fix
the amount of some discretionary penalty that he had
incurred. Lord Eskgrove began to give his opinion in
a very low voice, but loud enough to be heard by those
next him, to the effect that the fine ought to be &pound;50,
when Sir John, with his usual imprudence, interrupted
him and begged him to raise his voice, adding
that if judges did not speak so as to be heard they
might as well not speak at all. Lord Eskgrove, who
could never endure any imputation of bodily infirmity,
asked his neighbour, "What does the fellow say?"&mdash;"He
says, that if you don't speak out, you may as
well hold your tongue."&mdash;"Oh, is that what he says?
My lords, what I was saying was very simpell; I was
only sayingg, that in my humbell opinyon this fine
could not be less than &pound;250 sterlingg"&mdash;this sum being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>roared out as loudly as his old angry voice could
launch it.</p>

<p>A common saying of his to juries was: "And now,
gentle-men, having shown you that the panell's argument
is impossibill, I shall now proceed to show you
that it is extremely improbabill."</p>

<p>In condemning some persons to death for breaking
into Sir John Colquhoun's house and assaulting him
and others, as well as robbing them, Eskgrove, after
enumerating minutely the details of their crime, closed
his address to the prisoners with this climax: "All this
you did; and God preserve us! juist when they were
sitten doon tae their denner."</p>

<p>When condemning a tailor convicted of stabbing a
soldier, the offence was aggravated in Lord Eskgrove's
eyes by the fact that "not only did you murder him,
whereby he was berea-ved of his life, but you did
thrust, or push, or pierce, or project, or propell, the
le-thall weapon through the belly-band of his regimental
breeches, which were his Majesty's."</p>

<p>One of the most biting of caustic jests made by a
judge of the old Court of Session of Scotland, before its
reconstruction at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
was uttered during the hearing of a claim to a peerage.
The claimant was obviously resting his case upon
forged documents, and the judge suddenly remarked in
the broad dialect of the time, "If ye persevere ye'll nae
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
doot be a peer, but it will be a peer o' anither tree!"
The claimant did not appreciate this idea of being
grafted, and abandoned the case.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>To return to the stories of the earlier period of the
eighteenth century, there is one told of Lord Halkerston.
He was waited on by a tenant, who with a woeful
countenance informed his lordship that one of his
cows had gored a cow belonging to the judge, and he
feared the injured animal could not live. "Well, then,
of course you must pay for it," said his lordship. "Indeed,
my lord, it was not my fault, and you know I am
but a very poor man."&mdash;"I can't help that. The law
says you must pay for it. I am not to lose my cow, am
I?"&mdash;"Well, my lord, if it must be so, I cannot say
more. But I forgot what I was saying. It was my mistake
entirely. I should have said that it was your lordship's
cow that gored mine."&mdash;"Oh, is that it? That's
quite a different affair. Go along, and don't trouble me
just now. I am very busy. Be off, I say!"</p>

<p>And there is one of the testy old Lord Polkemmet
when he interrupted Mr. James Ferguson, afterwards
Lord Kilkerran, whose energy in enforcing a point in
his address to the Bench took the form of beating violently
on the table: "Maister Jemmy, dinna dunt; ye
may think ye're dunting it <i>intill me</i>, but ye're juist
<i>dunting it oot o' me</i>, man."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p>He was reputed to be dull, and rarely decided a case
upon the first hearing. On one occasion, after having
heard counsel, among whom was the Hon. Henry
Erskine, John Clerk, and others, in a cause of no great
difficulty, he addressed the Bar: "Well, Maister Erskine,
I heard you, and I thocht ye were richt; syne I heard
you, Dauvid, and I thocht ye were richt; and noo I hae
heard Maister Clerk, and I think he's richtest amang ye
a'. That bauthers me, ye see! Sae I man een tak' hame
the process an' wimble-wamble it i' ma wame a wee
ower ma toddy, and syne ye'se hae ma interlocutor."</p>

<p>"The Fifteen," as the full Bench of the old Court of
Session of Scotland was popularly called, were deliberating
on a bill of suspension and interdict relative to
certain caravans with wild beasts on the then vacant
ground which formed the beginning of the new communication
with the new Town of Edinburgh spreading
westwards and the Lawnmarket&mdash;now known as the
Mound. In the course of the proceedings Lord Bannatyne
fell fast asleep. The case was disposed of and the
next called, which related to a right of lien over certain
goods. The learned lord who continued dozing having
heard the word "lien" pronounced with an emphatic
accent by Lord Meadowbank, raised the following
discussion:</p>

<p>Meadowbank: "I am very clear that there was a lien
on this property."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p><p>Bannatyne: "Certain; but it ought to be chained,
because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Balmuto: "My lord, it's no a livin' lion, it's the Latin
word for lien" (leen).</p>

<p>Hermand: "No, sir; the word is French."</p>

<p>Balmuto: "I thought it was Latin, for it's in italics."</p>

</div>

<p>Henry Home (Lord Kames) was at once one of the
most enlightened and learned of Scottish judges of the
latter half of the eighteenth century, and one of the most
eccentric. His <i>History of Mankind</i> brought him into
correspondence with most of the famous men and
women of his day, and yet it was his delight to walk
up the Canongate and High Street with a half-witted
creature who made it his business to collect all the gossip
of the town and retail it to his lordship as he made
his way to Court in the morning. His humour was very
sarcastic, and nothing delighted him more than to observe
that it cut home. Leaving the Court one day
shortly before his death he met James Boswell, and
accosted him with, "Well, Boswell, I shall be meeting
your old father one of these days, what shall I say to
him how you are getting on now?" Boswell disdained
to reply. After a witness in a capital trial at Perth Circuit
concluded his evidence, Lord Kames said to him,
"Sir, I have one question more to ask you, and remember
you are on your oath. You say you are from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>Brechin?"&mdash;"Yes, my lord."&mdash;"When do you return
thither?"&mdash;"To-morrow, my lord."&mdash;"Do you know
Colin Gillies?"&mdash;"Yes, my lord; I know him very well."&mdash;"Then
tell him that I shall breakfast with him on
Tuesday morning."</p>

<p>Lord Kames used to relate a story of a man who
claimed the honour of his acquaintance on rather singular
grounds. His lordship, when one of the justiciary
judges, returning from the North Circuit to Perth,
happened one night to sleep at Dunkeld. The next
morning, walking towards the ferry, but apprehending
he had missed his way, he asked a man whom he met
to conduct him. The other answered, with much cordiality,
"That I will do with all my heart, my lord. Does
not your lordship remember me? My name's John &mdash;&mdash;. I
have had the <i>honour</i> to be before your lordship
for stealing sheep!"&mdash;"Oh, John, I remember you well;
and how is your wife? She had the honour to be before
me too, for receiving them, knowing them to be stolen."&mdash;"At
your lordship's service. We were very lucky;
we got off for want of evidence; and I am still going on
in the butcher trade."&mdash;"Then," replied his lordship,
"we may have the honour of meeting again."</p>

<p>Once when on Circuit his lordship had been dozing
on the bench, a noise created by the entrance of a
new panel woke him, and he inquired what the matter
was. "Oh, it's a woman, my lord, accused of child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>murder."&mdash;"And a weel farred b&mdash;h too," muttered
his lordship, loud enough to be heard by those present.</p>

advocates at the Scottish Bar in the first quarter of the
nineteenth century, and probably the last of them to
retain the old Scots style of pronunciation. His voice
was loud and his manner brow-beating, from which the
Bench suffered equally with his brother members of
the Bar. He suffered from a lameness in one leg, which
was made the subject of a passing remark by two
young women in the High Street of Edinburgh one
day as Clerk was making his way to Court. "There
goes John Clerk the lame lawyer," said one to the
other. Clerk overheard the remark, and turning back
addressed the speaker: "The lame man, my good woman,
not the lame lawyer."</p>

<p>The stories of his advocate days are numerous, and
many of them probably well known. In his retention
of old Scots pronunciation he got the better of Lord
Eldon when pleading before the House of Lords one
day. "That's the whole thing in plain English, ma
lords," he said. "In plain Scotch, you mean, Mr. Clerk."&mdash;"Nae
maitter, in plain common sense, ma lords, and
that's the same in a' languages." On another occasion
before the same tribunal he had frequently referred to
water, pronouncing it "watter," when he was interrupt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>ed
by the inquiry, "Do you spell water with two t's in
the north, Mr. Clerk?"&mdash;"No, my lord, but we spell
mainners wi' twa n's." And there is the well-known
one of his use of the word "enough," which in old Scots
was pronounced "enow." His repetition of the word
in the latter form drew from the Lord Chancellor the
remark that at the English Courts the word was
pronounced "enough." "Very well, my lord," replied
Clerk, and he proceeded with his address till coming
to describe his client, who was a ploughman, and his
client's claim, he went on: "My lords, my client is a
pluffman, who pluffs a pluff gang o' land in the parish
of," &amp;c. "Oh! just go on with your own pronunciation,
Mr. Clerk," remarked the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>His encounters with members of the Scottish Bench
were of a more personal character. Indeed, for years he
appears to have held most of them in unfeigned contempt.
A junior counsel on hearing their lordships
give judgment against his client exclaimed that he was
surprised at such a decision. This was construed into
contempt of Court, and he was ordered to attend at
the Bar next morning. Fearing the consequences of
his rash remark, he consulted John Clerk, who offered
to apologise for him in a way that would avert any unpleasant
result. Accordingly, when the name of the
delinquent was called, John Clerk rose and addressed
the Bench: "I am sorry, my lords, that my young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>friend so far forgot himself as to treat your lordships
with disrespect. He is extremely penitent, and you
will kindly ascribe his unintentional insult to his ignorance.
You will see at once that it did not originate
in that: he said he was surprised at the decision of your
lordships. Now, if he had not been very ignorant of
what takes place in this Court every day; had he known
your lordships but half so long as I have done, he
would not be surprised at anything you did."</p>

<p>Two judges, father and son, sat on the Scottish
Bench, in succession, under the title of Lord Meadowbank.
The second Lord Meadowbank was by no means
such a powerful judge as his father. In his Court, Clerk
was pressing his construction of some words in a conveyance,
and contrasting the use of the word "also"
with the use of the word "likewise."</p>

<p>"Surely, Mr. Clerk," said his lordship, "you cannot
seriously argue that 'also' means anything different
from 'likewise'! They mean precisely the same thing;
and it matters not which of them is preferred."&mdash;"Not
at all, my lord; there is all the difference in the world
between these two words. Let us take an instance:
your worthy father was a judge on that Bench; your
lordship is 'also' a judge on the same Bench; but it
does not follow that you are a judge 'like wise.'"</p>

<p>When Meadowbank was about to be raised to the
Bench he consulted John Clerk about the title he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>should adopt. Clerk's suggestion was "Lord Preserve
Us." The legal acquirements of James Wolfe Murray
were not held in high esteem by his brethren of the
Bar, and when he became a judge with the title of
Lord Cringletie, Clerk wrote the following clever epigram:</p>

<div class="poetryblock">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Necessity and Cringletie<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are fitted to a tittle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Necessity has nae law,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Cringletie as little."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The only man on the Bench for whom John Clerk
retained a respectfulness not generally exhibited to
others in that position was Lord President Blair. After
hearing the President overturn without any effort an
argument he had laboriously built up, and which appeared
to be regarded as unsurmountable by the audience
who heard it, Clerk sat still for a few moments,
then as he rose to leave the Court he was heard to say:
"My man, God Almighty spared nae pains when He
made your brains."</p>

<p>When he ascended the Bench in his sixty-fifth year,
and when his physical powers were declining, he received
the congratulations of his brother judges, one
of whom expressed surprise that he had waited so long
for the distinction. "Well, you see, I did not get 'doited'
just as soon as the rest of you," replied the new-made
judge.</p>

<p>Like the generation preceding his, Clerk was of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>very convivial disposition. Of him the story is told that
one Sunday morning, while people were making their
way to church, he appeared at his door in York Place
in his dressing-gown and cowl, with a lighted candle
in his hand, showing out two friends who had been carousing
with him, and in the firm belief that it was
about midnight instead of next mid-day. At the termination
of a Bannatyne Club dinner, where wit and
wine had contended for the mastery, the excited judge
on the way to his carriage tumbled downstairs and,
<i>miserabile dictu</i>, broke his nose, an accident which
compelled him to confine himself to the house for some
time. He reappeared, however, with a large patch on
his olfactory member, which gave a most ludicrous expression
to his face. On someone inquiring how this
happened, he said it was the effect of his studies.
"Studies!" ejaculated the inquirer. "Yes," growled
the judge; "ye've heard, nae doot, about <i>Coke upon
Littleton</i>, but I suppose you never before heard of
<i>Clerk upon Stair</i>!"</p>

<p>When asked by a friend what was the difference
between him and Lord Eldon, the Lord Chancellor of
England, Eldin replied; "Oh, there's only an 'i' of a
difference."</p>

<p>Charles Hay (Lord Newton), known in private life
as "The Mighty," has been described by Lord Cock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>burn
as "famous for law, paunch, whist, claret, and
worth." His indulgence in wine and his great bulk
made him slumbrous, and when sitting in Court after
getting the gist of a case he almost invariably fell fast
asleep. Yet it is strange to find it recorded that whenever
anything pertinent to the matter under discussion
was said he was immediately wide awake and in full
possession of his reasoning faculties. While a very
zealous but inexperienced counsel was pleading before
him, his lordship had been dozing, as usual, for
some time, till at last the young man, supposing him
asleep, and confident of a favourable judgment in his
case, stopped short in his pleading and, addressing
the other judges on the Bench, said: "My lords, it is
unnecessary that I should go on, as Lord Newton is
fast asleep."&mdash;"Ay, ay," cried Lord Newton, "you will
have proof of that by and by"&mdash;when, to the astonishment
of the young advocate, after a most luminous
view of the case, he gave a very decided and elaborate
judgment against him.</p>

<p>Lord Jeffrey himself declared that he only went to
Oxford to improve his accent, and according to some
of the older members of the Bar of his days, he only
lost his Scots accent and did not learn the English. A
story of his early days at the Bar is related to the
effect that when pleading before Lord Newton the
judge stopped him and asked in broad Scots, "Whaur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>were ye educat', Maister Jawfrey."&mdash;"Oxford, my
lord."&mdash;"Then I doot ye maun gang back there again,
for we can mak' nocht o' ye here." But Mr. Jeffrey
got back his own. For, before the same judge, happening
to speak of an "itinerant violinist," Lord Newton
inquired: "D'ye mean a blin' fiddler?"&mdash;"Vulgarly so
called, my lord," was the reply.</p>

<p>Circuit Courts were in Scotland, in the eighteenth
and early years of the nineteenth century (as in England
and Ireland), occasions for a great display in the
county towns in which they were held. Whether the
judges had arrived on horseback or as later in their
private carriages, there was always the procession to
the court-house, in which the notabilities of the district
took part. Lord Cockburn, who had no sympathy with
this part of a judge's duties, thus describes one of his
experiences in the early days of his Circuit journeys:
"Yet there are some of us who like the procession,
though it can never be anything but mean and ludicrous,
and who fancy that a line of soldiers, or the more
civic array of paltry policemen, or of doited special constables,
protecting a couple of judges who flounder in
awkward gowns and wigs through ill-paved streets,
followed by a few sneering advocates and preceded
by two or three sheriffs or their substitutes, with their
swords, which trip them, and a provost and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>bailie-bodies trying to look grand, the whole defended
by a poor iron mace, and advancing each with a different
step, to the sound of two cracked trumpets, ill-blown
by a couple of drunken royal trumpeters, the
spectators all laughing, who fancy that all this pretence
of greatness and reality of littleness contributes
to the dignity of judges." Things are changed now.
Even Lord Cockburn saw the change that the introduction
of railways made in the progress of Circuit
work, and with them a lesser display and more dignified
opening of the courts of justice in local towns.
But the older Circuits were times of much feasting and
merriment, in which the judges of that period took their
full share as well as the members of the Bar accompanying
them. In the eyes of some of these old worthies
it was part of the dignity of their position to sit
down after Court work at two o'clock in the morning to
a collation of salmon and roast beef, and drink bumpers
of claret and mulled port with the provosts and
other local worthies, although they were due in Court
that same morning at nine to try some miserable creature
for a serious crime. Lord Pitmilly had no stomach
for such proceedings, his inclination was stronger for
decorum and law than for revelling. Once at a Circuit
town he ordered his servant to bring to his room a
kettle of hot water. Lord Hermand on his way to dinner
at midnight, meeting the servant, said, "God bless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>me, is he going to make a whole kettle of punch&mdash;and
before supper too?"&mdash;"No, my lord, he's going to bed,
but he wants to bathe his feet."&mdash;"Feet, sir! what ails
his feet? Tell him to put some rum among it, and to
give it all to his stomach."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Circuit sermon was an important part of the
duties to which the judges had to attend in the course
of their visits in the country. One of these that Lord
Cockburn had to listen to was delivered from the text,
"What are these that are arrayed in white robes, and
whence came they?" There was nothing personal intended,
but the ermine on the judges gowns naturally
attracted significant glances from the other members
of the congregation. A Glasgow clergyman and friend
of the judge, not knowing that his lordship was present
in his church, preached from the text, "There was
in a city a judge which feared not God, neither regarded
man." The announcement of the text directed all eyes
towards the learned judge, which attracting the preacher's
attention nearly prevented him from proceeding
further with the service. The judge was the pious
Lord Moncreiff, the son of the Rev. Sir Henry Wellwood
Moncreiff, and the text stuck to him ever afterwards.
But there seemed to have been deliberation in
selection of the text made by a south-country minister
who, before Lord Justice Boyle and Samuel M'Cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>mick,
Advocate-Depute, preached from I Samuel vii.
16, "And Samuel went from year to year in circuit to
Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh." The two legal gentlemen
took offence at this audacious attempt to ridicule
the Court, they identifying the places mentioned in the
text as representing their circuit towns of Jedburgh,
Dumfries, and Ayr. In this connection maybe told the
story of Lord Hermand, beside whom stood the clergyman
whose duty it was to offer up the opening prayer
before the work of the Court began. He seemed to
think the company had assembled for no other purpose
than to hear him perform, and after praying loud and
long his lordship's patience gave way, and with a decided
jog of his elbow he exclaimed in a stage whisper,
"We've a lot of business to do, sir."</p>

<p>Lord Hermand's manner on the Bench conveyed the
impression that he was of an impatient, almost savage
temper, but in his domestic circle he was one of the
warmest-hearted of men, and one with the simplest
of tastes. His outbursts on the Bench, too, were emphasised
by what, in Scotland, was called "Birr"&mdash;the
emphatic energy of his pronunciation&mdash;which may be
imagined but cannot be transcribed in the following
dialogue between him and Lord Meadowbank.</p>

<p>Meadowbank: "We are bound to give judgment in
terms of the statute, my lords."</p>

<p>Hermand: "A statute! What's a statute? Words&mdash;mere
words. And am <i>I</i> to be tied down by words? No,
my laards; I go by the law of right reason."</p>

<p>He was a great friend of John Scott (Lord Eldon).
In a case appealed to the House of Lords, Scott had
taken the trouble to write out his speech, and read it
over to Hermand, inviting his opinion of it. "It is delightful&mdash;absolutely
delightful. I could listen to it for
ever," said Hermand. "It is so beautifully written,
and so beautifully read. But, sir, it's the greatest non<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>sense!
It may do very well for an English Chancellor,
but it would disgrace a clerk with us." The blunder
that drew forth this criticism was a gross one for a
Scottish lawyer, but one an English barrister might
readily fall into.</p>

<p>It was put forward in mitigation of the crime that
the prisoner was in liquor when, either rashly or accidentally,
he stabbed his friend. While the other
judges were in favour of a short sentence, Lord Hermand&mdash;who
had no sympathy with a man who could
not carry his liquor&mdash;was vehement for transportation:
"We are told that there was no malice, and that
the prisoner must have been in liquor. In liquor!
Why, he was drunk!... And yet he murdered the
very man who had been drinking with him! Good
God, my laards, if he will do this when he is drunk,
what will he not do when he is sober?"</p>

<p>On one of Lord Hermand's circuits a wag put a
musical-box, which played "Jack Alive," on one of the
seats of the Court. The music struck the audience with
consternation, and the judge stared in the air, looking
unutterable things, and frantically called out, "Macer,
what in the name of God is that?" The macer looked
round in vain, when the wag called out, "It's 'Jack
Alive,' my lord."&mdash;"Dead or alive, put him out this
moment," called out the judge. "We can't grip him,
my lord."&mdash;"If he has the art of hell, let every man as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>sist
to arraign him before me, that I may commit him
for this outrage and contempt." Everybody tried to
discover the offender, and fortunately the music ceased.
But it began again half an hour afterwards, and
the judge exclaimed, "Is he there again? By all that's
sacred, he shall not escape me this time&mdash;fence, bolt,
bar the doors of the Court, and at your peril let not a
man, living or dead, escape." All was bustle and confusion,
the officers looked east and west, and up in the
air and down on the floor; but the search was in vain.
The judge at last began to suspect witchcraft, and
exclaimed, "This is a <i>deceptio auris</i>&mdash;it is absolute
delusion, necromancy, phantasmagoria." And to the
day of his death the judge never understood the precise
origin of this unwonted visitation.</p>

<p>On another occasion, in his own Court in the Parliament
House, he was annoyed by a noise near the
door, and called to the macer, "What is that noise?"&mdash;"It's
a man, my lord."&mdash;"What does he want?"&mdash;"He
<i>wants in</i>, my lord."&mdash;"Keep him out!" The man, it
seems, did get in, and soon afterwards a like noise was
renewed, and his lordship again demanded, "What's
the noise there?"&mdash;"It's the same man, my lord."&mdash;"What
does he want now?"&mdash;"He <i>wants out</i>, my
lord."&mdash;"Then <i>keep him in</i>&mdash;I say, <i>keep him in</i>!"</p>

<p>Lord President Campbell, after the fashion of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>times, was somewhat addicted to browbeating young
counsel; and as bearding a judge on the Bench is not
a likely way to rise in favour, his lordship generally
got it all his own way. Upon one occasion, however,
he caught a tartar. His lordship had what are termed
pig's eyes, and his voice was thin and weak. Corbet, a
bold and sarcastic counsel in his younger days, had
been pleading before the Inner House, and as usual
the President commenced his attack, when his intended
victim thus addressed him: "My lord, it is not for
me to enter into any altercation with your lordship,
for no one knows better than I do the great difference
between us; you occupy the highest place on the
Bench, and I the lowest at the Bar; and then, my lord,
I have not your lordship's voice of thunder&mdash;I have
not your lordship's rolling eye of command."</p>

<p>Robert Macqueen (Lord Braxfield), the prototype of
Stevenson's "Weir of Hermiston," was known as the
"hanging judge"&mdash;the Judge Jeffreys of Scotland; but
he was a sound judge. He argued a point in a colloquial
style, asking a question, and himself supplying
the answer in his clear, abrupt manner. But he was illiterate,
and without the least desire for refined enjoyment,
holding in disdain natures less coarse than his
own; he shocked the feelings of those even of an age
which had less decorum than prevailed in that which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>succeeded, and would not be tolerated by the working
classes of to-day. Playing whist with a lady, he exclaimed,
"What are ye doin', ye damned auld ...,"
and then recollecting himself, "Your pardon's begged,
madam; I took ye for my wife." When his butler gave
up his place because his lordship's wife was always
scolding him: "Lord," he exclaimed, "ye've little to
complain o'; ye may be thankfu' ye're no mairred to
her."</p>

<p>His most notorious sayings from the Bench were
uttered during the trials for sedition towards the end
of the eighteenth century, and even some of these are
too coarse for repetition. "Ye're a very clever chiel,"
he said to one of the prisoners; "but ye wad be nane
the waur o' a hangin'." And to a juror arriving late in
Court he said, "Come awa, Maister Horner, come awa
and help us to hang ane o' they damned scoondrels."
Hanging was his term for all kinds of punishment.</p>

<p>To Margarot, a Baptist minister of Dundee&mdash;another
of the political prisoners of that time&mdash;he said,
"Hae ye ony coonsel, man?"&mdash;"No," replied Margarot.
"Dae ye want tae hae ony appointed?" continued
the Justice-Clerk. "No," replied the prisoner, "I only
want an interpreter to make me understand what your
lordship says."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We have already referred to Lord Moncreiff's piety,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>and to it must be added his great simplicity of nature.
Like many of his predecessors, he had a habit of
making long speeches to prisoners on their conviction;
but his intention was to help them to a better mode of
life, not to aggravate their feelings by silly or coarse
remarks. This habit, however, led him occasionally
into enunciating principles which rather astonished
his friends. In a murder case he found that the woman
killed was not the wife of the prisoner but his mistress,
which led his lordship to explain to the prisoner that it
might have been some apology for his crime had the
woman been his wife, because there was difficulty in
getting rid of her any other way. But the victim being
only his associate he could have left her at any time,
and consequently there were absolutely no ameliorating
circumstances in the case. From this point of view
it would seem to have been (in Lord Moncreiff's eyes)
less criminal to murder a wife than a mistress. In
another, a bigamy case, after referring to the perfidy
and cruelty to the women and their relations, Lord
Cockburn reports him to have said: "All this is bad;
but your true iniquity consists in this, that you degraded
that holy ceremony which our blessed Saviour
<i>condescended</i> to select as the type of the connection between
him and His redeemed Church."</p>

<p>In the Court of Session, the judges who do not attend
or give a proper excuse for their absence are (or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>were) liable to a fine. This, however, is never enforced:
but it is customary on the first day of the session for
the absentee to send an excuse to the Lord President.
Lord Stonefield having sent an excuse, and the Lord
President mentioning that he had done so, the Lord
Justice-Clerk said: "What excuse can a stout fellow
like him hae?"&mdash;"My lord," said the President, "he
has lost his wife." To which the Justice-Clerk replied:
"Has he? That is a gude excuse indeed, I wish we
had a' the same."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Lord Cockburn's looks, tones, language, and manner
were always such as to make one think that he believed
every word he said. On one occasion, before he
was raised to the Bench, when defending a murderer,
although he failed to convince the judge and jurymen
of the innocence of his client, yet he convinced the
murderer himself that he was innocent. Sentence of
death was pronounced, and the day of execution fixed
for the 3rd of March. As Lord Cockburn was passing
the condemned man, the latter seized him by the gown,
saying: "I have not got justice!" To this the advocate
coolly replied: "Perhaps not; but you'll get it on the
3rd of March."</p>

<p>Cockburn's racy humour displayed itself in another
serious case; one in which a farm-servant was charged
with maiming his master's cattle by cutting off their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>tails. A consultation was held on the question of the
man's mental condition at which the farmer was present,
and at the close of it some conversation took place
about the disposal of the cattle. Turning to the farmer
Cockburn said that they might be sold, but that he
would have to dispose of them wholesale for he could
not now <i>retail</i> them.</p>

<p>He was walking on the hillside on his estate of Bonaly,
near Edinburgh, talking to his shepherd, and speculating
about the reasons why his sheep lay on what
seemed to be the least sheltered and coldest situation
on the hill. Said his lordship: "John, if I were a sheep
I would lie on the other side of the hill." The shepherd
answered: "Ay, my lord; but if ye had been a sheep
ye would have had mair sense."</p>

<p>Sitting long after the usual hour listening to a prosy
counsel, Lord Cockburn was commiserated by a friend
as they left the Court together with the remark: "Counsel
has encroached very much on your time, my lord."&mdash;"Time,
time," exclaimed his lordship; "he has exhausted
time and encroached on eternity."</p>

<p>When a young advocate, Cockburn was a frequent
visitor at Niddrie Marischal, near Edinburgh, the residence
of Mr. Wauchope. This gentleman was very
particular about church-going, but one Sunday he
stayed at home and his young guest started for the
parish church accompanied by one of his host's hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>somest
daughters. On their way they passed through
the garden, and were so beguiled by the gooseberry
bushes that the time slipped away and they found
themselves too late for the service. At dinner the laird
inquired of his daughter what the text was, and when
she failed to tell him he put the question to Cockburn,
who at once replied: "The woman whom thou gavest
to be with me she gave me of the fruit and I did eat."</p>

<p>Jeffrey and Cockburn were counsel together in a
case in which it was sought to prove that the heir of an
estate was of low capacity, and therefore incapable of
administrating his affairs. Jeffrey had vainly attempted
to make a country witness understand his meaning as
he spoke of the mental imbecility and impaired intellect
of the party. Cockburn rose to his relief, and was
successful at once. "D'ye ken young Sandy &mdash;&mdash;?"&mdash;"Brawly,"
said the witness; "I've kent him sin' he was
a laddie."&mdash;"An' is there onything in the cratur, d'ye
think?"&mdash;"Deed," responded the witness, "there's
naething in him ava; he wadna ken a coo frae a cauf!"</p>

<p>When addressing the jury in a case in which an officer
of the army was a witness, Jeffrey frequently referred
to him as "this soldier." The witness, who was
in Court, bore this for a time, but at last, exasperated,
exclaimed, "I am not a soldier, I'm an officer!"&mdash;"Well,
gentlemen of the jury," proceeded Jeffrey, "this officer,
who on his own statement is no soldier," &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<p>Patrick, Lord Robertson, one of the senators of
the College of Justice, was a great humorist. He was
on terms of intimacy with the late Mr. Alexander
Douglas, W.S., who, on account of the untidiness of
his person, was known by the sobriquet of "Dirty
Douglas." Lord Robertson invited his friend to accompany
him to a ball. "I would go," said Mr. Douglas,
"but I don't care about my friends knowing that I attend
balls."&mdash;"Why, Douglas," replied the senator,
"put on a well-brushed coat and a clean shirt, and nobody
will know you." When at the Bar, Robertson
was frequently entrusted with cases by Mr. Douglas.
Handing his learned friend a fee in Scottish notes, Mr.
Douglas remarked: "These notes, Robertson, are, like
myself, getting old."&mdash;"Yes, they're both old and dirty,
Douglas," rejoined Robertson.</p>

<p>When Robertson was attending an appeal case in
the House of Lords he received great attention from
Lord Brougham. This gave rise to a report in the Parliament
House of Edinburgh that the popular Tory
advocate had "ratted" to the Liberal side in politics,
which found expression in the following <i>jeu d'esprit</i>:</p>

<div class="poetryblock">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When Brougham by Robertson was told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd condescend a place to hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Chancellor said, with wondering eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Viewing the <i>Rat's</i> tremendous size,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'That you a place would hold is true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But where's the place that would hold you?'"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>Lord Rutherford when at the Bar put an illustration
to the Bench in connection with a church case.
"Suppose the Justiciary Court condemned a man to
be hanged, however unjustly, could that man come into
this Court of Session and ask your lordships to
interfere?" and he turned round very majestically to
Robertson opposing him. "Oh, my lords," said Robertson,
"a case of suspension, clearly."</p>

<p>When a sheriff, Rutherford, dining with a number
of members of the legal profession, had to reply to the
toast, "The Bench of Scotland." In illustration of a
trite remark that all litigants could not be expected to
have the highest regard for the judges who have tried
their cases, he told the following story: A worthy
but unfortunate south-country farmer had fought his
case in the teeth of adverse decisions in the Lower
Courts to the bitter end in one of the divisions of the
Court of Session. After the decision of this tribunal
affirming the judgment he had appealed against, and
thus finally blasting his fondest hopes, he was heard
to mutter as he left the Court: "They ca' themselves
senators o' the College o' Justice, but it's ma opeenion
they're a' the waur o' drink!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was only a small point of law, but the two counsel
were hammering at each other tooth and nail. They
had been submitting this and that to his lordship for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>twenty minutes, and growing more and more heated
as they argued. At last: "You're an ass, sir!" shrieked
one. "And you're a liar, sir!" roared the other. Then
the judge woke up. "Now that counsel have identified
each other," said he, "let us proceed to the disputed
points."</p>

<p>A recent eminent judge of the Scottish Bench when
sitting to an artist for his portrait was asked what he
thought of the likeness. His lordship's reply was that
he thought it good enough, but he would have liked
"to see a little more dislike to Gladstone's Irish Bills
in the expression."</p>

<p>Lord Shand's shortness of stature has been a theme
of several stories. When he left Edinburgh after sitting
as a judge of the Court of Session for eighteen
years, one of his colleagues suggested that a statue
ought to be erected to him. "Or shall we say a statuette?"
was the remark of another friend. His lordship
lived at Newhailes&mdash;the property of one of the Dalrymple
family, several members of which were eminent
judges in the late seventeenth and the early eighteenth
centuries&mdash;and travelled to town by rail. The
guard was a pawky Aberdonian, and had evidently
been greatly struck by Lord Shand's appearance, for
his customary salutation to him, delivered no doubt in
a parental and patronising fashion, was: "And fu (how)
are ye the day, ma lordie?" His lordship's manner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>receiving this greeting is not recorded. Still another
anecdote on the same subject is that when still an advocate,
it was proposed to make Mr. Shand a Judge of
Assize. On the proposal being mentioned to a colleague
famous for his caustic wit, the latter with a good-humoured
sneer which raised a hearty laugh at the expense
of his genial friend, remarked: "Ah, a judge of a size,
indeed."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">
<a name="lord_young" id="lord_young"></a>
<img src="images/lord_young.jpg" width="283" height="390" alt="GEORGE YOUNG, LORD YOUNG." title="" />
<span class="caption">GEORGE YOUNG, LORD YOUNG.</span>
</div>

<p>Lord Young's wit was of this caustic turn and not
infrequently was intended to sting the person to whom
it was addressed. An advocate was wending his weary
way through a case one day, and in the course of making
a point he referred to a witness who had deponed
that he had seen two different things at one time and
consequently contradicted himself. Lord Young gave
vent to the feelings of his colleagues in the Second Division
of the Court, when he interrupted thus:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, I can see more than two things at
one time. I can see your paper, and beyond your paper
I can see you, and beyond you I can see the clock, and
I can see that you have been labouring for an hour
over a point that is capable of being expressed in a
sentence."</p>

<p>In the course of an argument in the same division,
counsel had occasion to refer to "Fraser" (a brother
judge) "on Husband and Wife." Lord Young, inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>rupting,
asked: 'Hasn't Fraser another book?'&mdash;'Yes,
my lord, 'Master and Servant!''&mdash;'Well,' said Lord
Young, 'isn't that the same thing?'</p>

<p>Owing to a vacancy on the Bench having been kept
open for a long period, Lord Young's roll had become
very heavy. Hearing that a new colleague had been
appointed, and like the late judge had adopted a title
ending in "hill," he gratefully quoted the lines of the
one hundred and twenty-first psalm:</p>

<div class="poetryblock">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I to the hills will lift mine eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whence doth come mine aid."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Before the same judge, two prominent advocates in
their day were debating a case. One of them was a particularly
well-known figure, the feature of whose pinafore,
if he wore one, would be its extensive girth. The
other advocate, who happened to be rather slim, was
addressing his lordship: "My learned friend and I are
particularly at one upon this point. I may say, my lord,
that we are virtually in the same boat." Here his opponent
broke in: "No, no, my lord, we are nothing of
the kind. I do not agree with that." Lord Young, leaning
across the bench, remarked: "No, I suppose you
would need a whole boat to yourself."</p>

<p>It is also attributed to Lord Young that, when Mr.
Baird of Cambusdoon bequeathed a large sum of
money to the Church of Scotland to found the lecture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>ship
delivered under the auspices of the Baird Trust,
he remarked that it was the highest fire insurance premium
he had ever heard of. "Possibly, my lord," observed
a fire insurance manager who heard the remark;
"but you will admit that cases occur where the
premium scarcely covers the risk."</p>

<p>Lord Guthrie tells that when, as an advocate, he was
engaged in a case before Lord Young, he mentioned
that his client was a Free Church minister. "Well,"
said Lord Young, "that may be, but for all that he may
perhaps be quite a respectable man."</p>

<p>And there is the story that when Mr. Young was
Lord Advocate for Scotland a vacancy occurred on
the Bench and two names were mentioned in connection
with it. One was that of Mr. Horne, Dean of
Faculty, a very tall man, and the other Lord Shand.
"So, Mr. Young," said a friend, "you'll be going to
appoint Horne?"&mdash;"I doubt if I will get his length,"
was the reply. "Oh, then," queried the friend, "you'll
be going to appoint Shand?"&mdash;"It's the least I could
do," answered the witty Lord Advocate.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"What is your occupation?" asked Lord Ardwall
of a witness in a case. "A miner, sir."&mdash;"Good; and
how old are you?"&mdash;"Twenty, sir."&mdash;"Ah, then you
are a minor in more senses than one." Whereat, no
doubt, the Court laughed. "Now, my lord, we come to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>the question of commission received by the witness,
which I was forgetting," said a counsel before the same
judge one day. "Ah, don't commit the omission of omitting
the commission," replied his lordship.</p>

<p>An unfortunate miner had been hit on the head by a
lump of coal, and the judges of the First Division of the
Court of Session were considering whether his case
raised a question of law or of fact. "The only law I can
see in the matter," said Lord Maclaren, "is the law of
gravitation."</p>

<p>In a fishing case heard in the Court of Session some
years ago, a good deal of evidence was led on the subject
of taking immature salmon from a river in the
north. The case was an important one, and the evidence
was taken down in shorthand notes and printed
for the use of the judge and counsel next day. The
evidence of one of the witnesses with respect to certain
of the salmon taken was that "some of them were
kelts." When his lordship turned over the pages of the
printed evidence next morning to refresh his memory,
he was astonished to find it stated by one of the witnesses
in regard to the salmon that "some of them wore
kilts."</p>

<p>Many other stories, particularly of the older judges,
might be given, were they not too well known. We
may therefore close this chapter with the following epigram
by a Scottish writer, which is decidedly point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>ed
and clever, and has the additional merit of being
self-explanatory:</p>

<div class="poetryblock">

<span class="i0">Who held, 'It surely can't be wrong,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For God helps those who help themselves.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when before the Court he came,<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER SIX<br />
THE ADVOCATES OF SCOTLAND</h2>




<p>Since days when Sir Walter Scott
gathered round him at the fireplace in the Parliament
Hall of Edinburgh a company of young brother advocates
to hear the latest of Lord Eskgrove's eccentric
sayings from the Bench, that rendezvous has been
the favourite resort for story-telling among succeeding
generations of counsel. While the Court is in session,
they vary their daily walk up and down the hall
by lounging round the spot where the future Wizard of
the North proved a strong counter-attraction to many
an interesting case being argued before a Lord Ordinary
in the alcoves on the opposite side of the hall,
which was then the "Outer House." It is even asserted
that this same fireplace is the hatchery of many of
the amusing paragraphs daily appearing in a column
of a certain Edinburgh newspaper. But of all the witticisms
that have enlivened the dull hours of the briefless
barrister in that historic hall during the past
century, none will stand the test of time or be read with
so much pleasure as those of that prince of wits, the
Hon. Henry Erskine.</p>

<span class="caption">THE HON. HENRY ERSKINE, LORD ADVOCATE AND DEAN OF FACULTY OF ADVOCATES.</span>
</div>

<p>Hairry, as he was familiarly called both by judge
and counsel, was in an eminent degree the "advocate
of the people." It is said that a poor man in a remote
district of Scotland thus answered an acquaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>ance
who wished to dissuade him from "going to law"
with a wealthy neighbour, by representing the hopelessness
of being able to meet the expenses of litigation.
"Ye dinna ken what ye're saying, maister," replied
the litigious northerner; "there's no' a puir man
in a' Scotland need want a freen' or fear a foe, sae lang
as Hairry Erskine lives."</p>

<p>When the autocratic reign of Henry Dundas as Lord
Advocate was for a time eclipsed, Henry Erskine was
his successor in the Whig interest. In his good-humoured
way Dundas proposed to lend Erskine his embroidered
gown, suggesting that it would not be long
before he (Dundas) would again be in office. "Thank
you," said Hairry, "I am well aware it is made to suit
any party, but it will never be said of me that I assumed
the abandoned habits of my predecessor."</p>

<p>Having been speaking in the Outer House at the
Bar of Lord Swinton, a very good, but a very slow and
deaf judge, Erskine was called away to Lord Braxfield's
Court. On appearing his lordship said: "Well,
Dean" (he was then Dean of the Faculty of Advocates),
"what is this you've been talking so loudly about to
my Lord Swinton?"&mdash;"About a cask of whisky, my
lord, but I found it no easy matter to make it run in
his lordship's head."</p>

<p>He was once defending a client, a lady of the name
of Tickell, before one of the judges who was an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>timate
friend, and he opened his address to his lordship
in these terms: "Tickell, my client, my lord."
But the judge was equal to the occasion and interrupted
him by saying: "Tickle her yourself, Harry, you're
as able to do it as I am."</p>

<p>Lord Balmuto was a ponderous judge and not very
"gleg in the uptak" (did not readily see a point), and
retained the utmost gravity while the whole Court was
convulsed with laughter at some joke of the witty Dean.
Hours later, when another case was being heard, the
judge would suddenly exclaim: "Eh, Maister Hairry,
a' hae ye noo, a' hae ye noo, vera guid, vera guid."</p>

<p>Hugo Arnot, a brother advocate, a tall, cadaverous-looking
man, who suffered from asthma, was one day
munching a speldin (a sun-dried whiting or small haddock,
a favourite article supplied at that time, and till
a generation ago, by certain Edinburgh shops). Erskine
coming up to Arnot, the latter explained that he was
having his lunch. "So I see," said Harry, "and you're
very like your meat." On another occasion these two
worthies were discussing future punishment for errors
of the flesh, Arnot taking a liberal, and Erskine a
strongly Calvinist view. As they were parting Erskine
said to Arnot, referring to his spare figure:</p>

<div class="poetryblock">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For &mdash;&mdash; and blasphemy by the mercy of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To flesh and to blood much may be forgiven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I've searched all the Scriptures and text I find none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the same is extended to skin and to bone."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>
<p>Erskine's brother, the extremely eccentric Lord Buchan,
who thought himself as great a jester as his two
younger brothers, the Lord Chancellor of England and
the Dean of Faculty of Advocates, one day putting
his head below the lock of a door, exclaimed: "See,
Harry, here's Locke on the Human Understanding."&mdash;"Rather
a poor edition, my lord," replied the younger
brother.</p>

<p>Sir James Colquhoun, Baronet of Luss, Principal
Clerk of Session, towards the close of the eighteenth
century was one of the odd characters of his time, and
was made the butt of all the wags of the Parliament
House. On one occasion, whilst Henry Erskine was
in the Court in which Sir James was on duty, he
amused himself by making faces at the Principal Clerk,
who was greatly annoyed at the strange conduct of
the tormenting lawyer. Unable to bear it longer, he
disturbed the gravity of the Court by rising from the
table at which he sat and exclaiming, "My lord, my
lord, I wish you would speak to Harry, he's aye making
faces at me." Harry, however, looked as grave as
a judge and the work of the Court proceeded, until Sir
James, looking again towards the bar, witnessed a
new grimace from his tormentor, and convulsed Bench,
Bar, and audience by roaring out: "There, there, my
lord, see he's at it again."</p>

<p>Hugo Arnot's eccentricity took various forms. In
his house in South St. Andrew Street, in the new town
of Edinburgh, he greatly annoyed a lady who lived in
the same tenement by the violence with which he kept
ringing his bell for his servant. The lady complained;
but what was her horror next day to hear several pistol-shots
fired in the house, which was Arnot's new
method of demanding his valet's immediate attendance.</p>

<p>In his professional capacity, however, he was guided
by a high sense of honour and of moral obligation.
In a case submitted for his consideration, which seemed
to him to possess neither of these qualifications, he
with a very grave face said to his client: "Pray what
do you suppose me to be?"&mdash;"Why, sir," answered
the client, "I understood you to be a lawyer."&mdash;"I
thought, sir," replied Arnot, "you took me for a scoundrel."
On another occasion he was consulted by a lady,
not remarkable either for youth or beauty or for good
temper, as to the best method of getting rid of the importunities
of a rejected admirer. After having told her
story and claiming a relationship with him because her
own name was Arnot, she wound up with: "Ye maun
advise me what I ought to do with this impertinent
fellow."&mdash;"Oh, marry him by all means, it's the only
way to get quit of his importunities," was Arnot's advice.
"I would see him hanged first," retorted the lady.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>"Nay, madam," rejoined Arnot, "marry him directly
as I said before, and by the Lord Harry he'll soon
hang himself."</p>

<p>Of the convivial habits of the Bar as well as the
Bench in Scotland at this period many stories are told.
The Second Lord President Dundas once refused to
listen to counsel who obviously showed signs of having
come into Court fresh from a tavern debauch. The
check given by the President appeared to effect some
sobering of the counsel's faculties and he immediately
addressed his lordship upon the dignity of the Faculty
of Advocates, winding up a long harangue with: "It is
our duty and our privilege to speak, my lord, and it is
your duty and your privilege to hear."</p>

<p>Another counsel in a similar condition of haziness
hurriedly entered the Court and took up the case in
which he was engaged; but forgetting for which side
he had been fee'd, to the unutterable amazement of the
agent, delivered a long and fervent speech in the teeth
of the interests he had been expected to support. When
at last the agent made him understand the mistake he
had made, he with infinite composure resumed his oration
by saying: "Such, my lord, is the statement you
will probably hear from my brother on the opposite
side of the case. I shall now show your lordship how
utterly untenable are the principles and how distort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ed
are the facts upon which this very specious statement
has proceeded." And so he went over the same
ground and most angelically refuted himself from the
beginning of his former pleading to the end.</p>

<p>When a barrister, pleading before Lord Mansfield,
pronounced a Latin word with a false quantity his
lordship rarely let the opportunity pass without exhibiting
his own precise knowledge of that language.
"My lords," said the Scottish advocate, Crosbie, at the
bar of the House of Lords, "I have the honour to appear
before your lordships as counsel for the Cur&#259;tors."&mdash;"Ugh,"
groaned the Westminster-Oxford law
lord, softening his reproof by an allusion to his Scottish
nationality, "Cur&#257;tors, Mr. Crosbie, Cur&#257;tors: I
wish <i>our</i> countrymen would pay a little more attention
to prosody."&mdash;"My lord," replied Mr. Crosbie, with
delightful readiness and composure, "I can assure you
that <i>our</i> countrymen are very proud of your lordship
as the greatest sen&#257;tor and or&#257;tor of the present age."</p>

<p>A very young Scottish advocate, afterwards an eminent
judge on the Scottish Bench, pleading before the
House of Lords, ventured to challenge some early
judgments of that House, on which he was abruptly
asked by Lord Brougham: "Do you mean, sir, to call
in question the solemn decisions of this venerable
tribunal?"&mdash;"Yes, my lord," coolly replied the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>counsel, "there are some people in Scotland who are
bold enough to dispute the soundness of some of your
lordship's <i>own</i> decisions."</p>

<p>Sheriff Logan, when pleading before Lord Cunningham
in a case which involved numerous points of
form, on some of which he ventured to express an
opinion, was repeatedly interrupted by old Beveridge,
the judge's clerk&mdash;a great authority on matters of form&mdash;who
unfortunately possessed a very large nasal organ,
which literally overhung his mouth. "No, no,"
said the clerk, as the sheriff was quietly explaining
the practice in certain cases. On which Logan, somewhat
nettled at the blunt interruption, coolly replied:
"But, my lord, I say: 'Yes, yes, yes,' in spite of Mr.
Beveridge's <i>noes</i>."</p>

<p>In the days of Sheriff Harper, Mr. Richard Lees,
solicitor, Galashiels, was engaged in a case for a client
who was not overburdened with the necessary funds
for legal proceedings. However, he was thought good
enough for the expenses in the case. The action went
against Mr. Lees' client, and then Mr. Lees rose to
plead for modified expenses. But the client leant across
to speak to the lawyer and said in a hoarse whisper
audible over the Court: "Dinna stent (limit) yoursels
for the expenses for a haena a fardin'." This was too
much even for the gravity of the Bench.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>
<p>Not many years ago, in the High Court at Glasgow,
a case was heard before an eminent judge still on the
Scottish Bench, in which the accused had committed
a very serious assault and robbery. He was unable
to engage counsel for his defence, and the usual
course was adopted of putting his case in the hands of
"counsel for the poor." There was really no defence;
but the young advocate who undertook the task had to
make the best of it, and the plea he put forward was
that the accused was so drunk at the time he did not
know what he was doing. It was the best thing he
could do in the circumstances, as all the success he
could expect to make with a well-known felon was a
mitigation of the sentence. When it came to his time
to address the Court, he set out in the following fashion:
"My lord and gentlemen of the jury, you all know
what it is to be drunk."</p>

<p>It is most important to be exact in stating the times
of the movements of a person accused of murder. In
a recent case this point was very minutely examined
by an advocate in the Scottish Court. One witness
deponed that she saw the accused in a certain place
at 5.40 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> "Are you sure," asked the learned counsel
in a tone calculated to make a witness not quite
sure after all, "are you sure it was not twenty minutes
to six?" And then he seemed surprised at the laughter
his question had raised.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>
<p>When Mr. Ludovick Mair, who was a very short
man, was Sheriff-Substitute of Lanarkshire, he was
called upon, at an Ayrshire Burns Club dinner, to propose
the toast of the "Ayrshire Lasses." After alluding
to the honour that had been conferred upon him,
happily said that "Provided his fair clients were prepared
to be 'contented wi' little and canty wi' mair,'
he had no compunction in performing the agreeable
duty."</p>

<p>In the Glasgow Small Debt Court where the sheriff
frequently presided, a young lawyer's exhaustive eloquence
in striving to prove that his client was not due
the sum sued for, drew from his lordship the following
interruption: "Excuse me, sir, but throughout the conflict
and turmoil engendered by this desperate dispute
with the pursuer I presume the British Empire is not
in any danger?"&mdash;"No, my lord," came the reply, "but
I fear after that interrogation from your lordship my
client's case is?"</p>

<p>On one occasion the sheriff, becoming impatient
with an agent's protracted speech, rebuked him thus:
"Be brief, be brief, my dear sir; time is short and eternity
is long!" And again on being asked by an agent
not to allow a witty old Irishman to act as the spokesman
of "the defendant" on the ground that the Irishman
was not now in the defendant's employment, the
sheriff sternly said to the would-be witness: "Now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>answer me truthfully, mirthful Michael, are you or are
you not in the defendant's employment?"&mdash;"Well, my
lord of lords," was the reply, "that is to say, in the
learned phraseology of the law, <i>pro tem</i> I am and
<i>ultimo</i> and <i>proximo</i> I amn't."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Two stories are told of the late Sheriff Balfour. His
lordship was addressing a prisoner at unusual length,
when he was interrupted more than once by a <i>sotto
voce</i> observation from his then clerk, who was very
impatient when the luncheon hour drew near. Accustomed
to this interruption, the sheriff, as a rule, took
no notice of them. On this occasion, however, he threw
down his quill with a show of annoyance, leaned back
in his chair, and addressed the interrupter thus: "I
say, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, are you, or am I, sheriff here?" Promptly
came the unabashed reply: "You, of course; but
your lordship knows that this woman has been frequently
here," meaning that it was idle to address
words of counsel to the prisoner. On another occasion,
the sheriff was pulled up by a male prisoner, who took
exception to his version of the story of the crime, and
concluded: "So you see I've got your lordship there."&mdash;"Have
you?" was the sheriff's rejoinder. "No, but
I've got you&mdash;three months hard."</p>

<p>A law agent was talking at length against an
opinion which Sheriff Balfour had already indicated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>Twice the sheriff essayed in vain to stay the torrent
that was flowing uselessly past the mill. At last, in a
more decided tone, he asked the agent to allow him
just one word, after which he would engage not to interrupt
him again. "Certainly, milord," said the agent.
"Decree," said the sheriff.</p>

<p>Counsel who are briefless and who spend much
time in perambulating the floor of Parliament Hall
should be as careful in their dress as their more fortunate
neighbours who jostle each other in the lobbies as
they rush from one Court to another. A company of
Americans visiting the Courts one day made a casual
inquiry of one of the advocates "in waiting," who
politely offered to show them all that is to be seen. As
they were leaving, one of the party caught hold of a
passing solicitor and after apologising for stopping him
inquired: "This&mdash;this&mdash;this gentleman has been very
good in showing us over your beautiful place. Would
it be correct to give him something?"&mdash;"Yes, certainly,"
said the busy practitioner, "and it will be the first
fee he has earned, to my knowledge, for the last ten
years."</p>

<p>An advocate of the present day, in trying to induce
the Second Division of the Court of Session to reverse
a decision pronounced in Glasgow Sheriff Court
somewhat startled the Bench by reminding them that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>their lordships were only mortal after all. "Are you
quite sure of that?" asked the presiding judge. Counsel
judiciously refrained from replying to this poser.
The incident recalls an occasion in the Second Division
when it was presided over by Lord Justice-Clerk
Moncreiff. A junior counsel was debating a case
in the division, and, apparently finding he was not
making much headway, invited their lordships to imagine
for the moment that they were navvies, and to look
at the question from the point of view of the worker.
In stately tones the Lord Justice-Clerk informed the
audacious junior that his invitation was unsuited to
the dignity of the Court.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A learned counsel at the Bar prided himself on the
juvenility of his appearance, and boasted that he looked
twenty years younger than he was. He was cross-examining
a very prepossessing and uncommonly self-possessed
young woman as to the age of a person
whom she knew quite well, but could get no satisfactory
answer. "Well," he persisted, "but surely you
must have been able to make a good guess at his age,
having seen him often."&mdash;"People don't always look
their age."&mdash;"No, but you can surely form a good idea
from their looks. Now, how old should you say I am?"
"You might be sixty by your looks, but judging by the
questions you ask I should say about sixteen!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>
<p>Much amusement is afforded by the answers given
by witnesses to judges and counsel. They form the
theme of legions of stories, and we append a selection
to this chapter of legal wit of the Bar.</p>

<p>An Irishman before Lord Ardwall was giving evidence
on the question whether having lived eleven
years in Glasgow he was a domiciled Scotsman. He
swore that he was, and as a question of succession depended
upon the domicile the point was of importance.
The opposing counsel thought he had him cornered
when on the list of voters for an Irish constituency he
found the witness's name. But Pat was equal to the
occasion. "It's a safe sate," he said; "they never revise
the lists," and by way of clinching the argument, he
added: "Shure there's men in Oireland who have
been in their graves for twenty years who voted at the
last election."</p>

<p>Legal gentlemen sometimes resort to methods not
quite in accordance with usual practice to elicit information
from stubborn witnesses. In Glasgow Sheriff
Court one day a somewhat long and involved question
was addressed by the cross-examining agent to a witness
who, from his stout build and imperturbable
manner, looked the embodiment of Scottish caution.
The witness, who was not to be so easily "had," having
regarded his questioner with a steady gaze for the
space of almost a minute, at last broke silence: "Would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>you mind, sir," said he, "just repeating that question,
and splitting it into bits?" And after the Court had regained
its composure the discomfited agent humbly
proceeded to subdivide the question.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the old days when Highlanders "kist oot"
(quarrelled) they resorted to the claymore, but the
hereditary fighting spirit appears nowadays in an appeal
to the law. Perth Sheriff Courts witness many a
"bout" between the stalwarts, who are not amiss to
clash all round if need be. "You must have been in
very questionable company at the show?" inquired a
sheriff of a farmer. "Weel, ma lord&mdash;you wis the last
gentleman I spoke to that day as I was coming oot!"
was his reply.</p>

<p>The pointed insinuation to another witness in a
claim case at the same Court. "I think I have seen you
here rather often of late," drew the reply, "Nae doot,
if a'm no takin' onybody here&mdash;then it's them that's
takin' me!"</p>

<p>Quite recently an old farmer in Perthshire, who had
been rather severely cross-examined by the opposing
counsel, had his sweet revenge when the sheriff, commenting
on the case, inquired: "There seems to be a
great deal of dram-dramming at C&mdash;&mdash; on Tuesdays, I
imagine?"&mdash;"Aye, whiles," was the canny reply&mdash;and
immediately following it up, as he pointed across at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>the rival lawyer, he continued&mdash;"an' that nicker ower
there can tak' a bit dram wi' the best o' them!"</p>

<p>A young advocate, as junior in a licensing club case,
had to cross-examine the certifying Justice of the Peace
who was very diffuse and rather evasive in his answers.
"Speak a little more simply and to the point, please,"
said counsel mildly. "You are a little ambiguous, you
know."&mdash;"I am not, sir," replied the witness indignantly;
"I have been teetotal for a year."</p>

<p>It is a fact well known to lawyers that it is a risky
thing to call witnesses to character unless you know
exactly beforehand what they are going to say. Here
is an instance in point. "You say you have known
the prisoner all your life?" said the counsel. "Yes,
sir," was the reply. "Now," was the next question,
"in your opinion is he a man who is likely to have
been guilty of stealing this money?"&mdash;"Well," said
the witness thoughtfully, "how much was it?"</p>

<p>In a County Sheriff Court his lordship addressed a
witness: "You said you drove a milk-cart, didn't you?"
"No, sir, I didn't."&mdash;"Don't you drive a milk-cart?"
"No, sir."&mdash;"Ah! then what do you do, sir?"&mdash;"I drive
a horse."</p>

<p>A well-known lawyer not now in practice, who had
risen from humble parentage to be Procurator Fiscal
of his county, once got a sharp retort from a witness
in Court. It was a case of law-burrows&mdash;well known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>in Scotland&mdash;which requires a person to give security
against doing violence to another. A lady had assaulted
a priest who in the discharge of his duty had been
visiting her husband&mdash;a member of his flock. The
lady was herself a Protestant, and suspected the reverend
gentleman of designs on her husband's property
for behoof of his Church. The witness in the box
was prepared on every point, and the following dialogue
ensued&mdash;P.F.: "Who was your father?" Lady:
"My father was a gentleman." P.F.: "Yes, but who
was he?" Lady: "He was a good man and much respected,
although he didn't make such a noise in the
world as yours." The P.F.'s father had been the town
crier.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was to the same lawyer who asked the
question of a labouring man: "Are you the husband of
the previous witness?" and got the answer: "I dinna
ken onything aboot the previous witness, but if it was
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, a'm her man."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The macer who calls the cases coming before the
judges in Court was in older days an interesting personality.
Lord Cockburn recalls the time when this
duty was performed by the "crier" putting his head
out of a small window high up in the wall of the Parliament
House and shouting down to the counsel and agents
assembled below him. Now it is performed from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>a raised dais on the floor of the hall, and it is no joke
when the macer has to call in stentorian tones such a
case as "Dampskibsselskabet Danmary <i>v.</i> John Smith."
Learned members of the Faculty approach such a difficulty
otherwise. During "motions" one day an astute
counsel said, "In number 11 of your lordship's roll."
"What did you call it?" inquired the judge. "I called
it number 11," na&iuml;vely replied counsel. The case was
"Fiskiveidschlutafjelagid Island <i>v.</i> Standard Fishing
Company."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The administration of the oath in Courts of Justice
is apt to become perfunctory, and some sheriffs shorten
the formula, so that it is administered somewhat after
this fashion: "I swearbalmitygod, that I will tell the
truth, the wholetruth, anothingbuthetruth." There is
one sheriff more punctilious, and recently he administered
the oath to a female witness, making her recite
it in sections after him. "I swear by Almighty God"
(pause). Witness: "I swear by Almighty God."&mdash;"As
I shall answer to God." Witness: "As I shall answer
to God."&mdash;"At the Great Day of Judgment." The witness
stumbled over this clause, and the sheriff had to
repeat it twice. As she ran more glibly over the concluding
words, the sheriff remarked: "It's extraordinary
how many people come to this Court who seem
never to have heard of that great occasion."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>
<p>This is what took place in a Glasgow Court. Sheriff:
"Repeat this after me, 'I swear by Almighty God.'"
Witness: "I swear by Almighty God." Sheriff: "I
will tell the truth." Witness: "I will tell the truth."
Sheriff: "The whole truth." Witness: "I <span class="smcap">HOPE</span>
so!"</p>

<p>In Edinburgh Sheriff Small Debt Court the oath
was administered to a witness who was dull of hearing.
"I swear by Almighty God," said the sheriff. The witness
put his hollowed hand to his ear and asked:
"Wha dae ye sweer by?" Many Court reporters have
heard a witness swear to tell "the truth, the whole
truth, and anything but the truth"; and one old lady
(mistaking certain words recited by the judge) affirmed
her determination to tell the truth "with a great deal of
judgment."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>As we indicated at the beginning of this volume,
stories of wit and humour from the ranks of agents in
the legal profession are much rarer than in those of the
Bench and the Bar. From the <i>Court of Session Garland</i>
we quote the following relating to a worthy practitioner
in the days when Councillor Pleydell played
"high jinks" in his favourite tavern.</p>

<p>In old times some stray agents in Scotland might be
found who were not particularly distinguished for professional
attainments, and who sometimes could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>"draw" a paper as it is termed. One of these worthies
was impressed with the idea that his powers were
equal to the preparation of a petition for the appointment
of a factor. His clerk was summoned, pens, ink,
and paper placed before him, and the process of dictation
commenced: "Unto the Right Honourable."
"Right Honourable," echoed the clerk. "The Lords
of Council and Session."&mdash;"Session," continued the
scribe&mdash;"the Petition of Alexander Macdonald, tenant
in Skye&mdash;Skye&mdash;humbly sheweth&mdash;sheweth." "Stop,
John, read what I've said."&mdash;"Yes, sir. 'Unto the
Right Honourable the Lords of Council and Session
the Petition of Alexander Macdonald, tenant in Skye,
humbly sheweth.'"&mdash;"Very well, John, very well.
Where did you stop?"&mdash;"Humbly sheweth&mdash;that the
petitioner&mdash;petitioner"&mdash;here a pause for a minute&mdash;"that
the petitioner. It's down, sir." Here the master
got up, walked about the room, scratched his head,
took snuff, but in vain; the inspiration had fled with
the mysterious word "petitioner." The clerk looked
up somewhat amazed that his master had got that
length, and at last ventured to suggest that the difficulty
might be got over. "How, John?" exclaimed his
master. "As you have done the most important part,
what would you say, sir, to send the paper to be finished
by Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; with a guinea?"&mdash;"The very thing, John,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>tak' the paper to Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, and as we've done the
maist fickle pairt of the work he's deevilish weel aff wi'
a guinea."</p>

<p>We are indebted to the author of that capital collection
of Scottish anecdote, <i>Thistledown</i>, for the following
story, as illustrating one of the many humorous
attempts to get the better of the law, and one in which
the lawyer was "hoist with his own petard." A dealer
having hired a horse to a lawyer, the latter, either
through bad usage or by accident, killed the beast,
upon which the hirer insisted upon payment of its
value; and if it was not convenient to pay costs, he
expressed his willingness to accept a bill. The lawyer
offered no objection, but said he must have a long date.
The hirer desired him to fix his own time, whereupon
the writer drew a promissory note, making it payable
at the day of judgment. An action ensued, when in
defence, the lawyer asked the judge to look at the bill.
Having done so, the judge replied: "The bill is perfectly
good, sir; and as this is the day of judgment, I
decree that you pay to-morrow."</p>

<p>Joseph Gillon was a well-known Writer to the Signet
early in the nineteenth century. Calling on him

Gillon, "and isn't it here that I make my bread?"</p>

<p>A celebrated Scottish preacher and pastor was visiting
the house of a solicitor who was one of his flock,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>but had a reputation of indulging in sharp practice.
The minister was surprised to meet there two other
members of his flock whose relations with the solicitor
were not at the time known to be friendly or otherwise.
In course of conversation the solicitor, alluding to some
disputed point, appealed to the minister: "Doctor,
these are members of your flock; may I ask whether
you look on them as black or as white sheep?"&mdash;"I
don't know," answered the minister, "whether they
are black or white sheep; but this I know, that if they
are long here they are pretty sure to be <i>fleeced</i>."</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of this story is the one of a Scottish countrywoman
who applied to a respectable solicitor for
advice. After detailing all the circumstances of the case,
she was asked if she had stated the facts exactly as
they had occurred. "Ou ay, sir," rejoined the applicant;
"I thought it best to tell you the plain truth;

<h2>CHAPTER SEVEN<br />
THE AMERICAN BENCH &amp; BAR</h2>

<p>The Rev. H. R. Haweis has defined "humour
as the electric atmosphere, wit as the flash. A
situation provides atmospheric humour, and with the
culminating point of it comes the flash." This definition
is peculiarly applicable to the humour of the
Bench and Bar when the situation invariably provides
the atmosphere for the wit. Not less so is this the
case in American Courts than in British. Before Chief
Justice Parsons was raised to the Bench, and when he
was the leading lawyer of America, a client wrote, stating
a case, requesting his opinion upon it, and enclosing
twenty dollars. After the lapse of some time, receiving
no answer, he wrote a second letter, informing
him of his first communication. Parsons replied that
he had received both letters, had examined the case
and formed his opinion, but somehow or other "it stuck
in his throat." The client understood this hint, sent
him one hundred dollars, and received the opinion.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">THEOPHILUS PARSONS, CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS.</span>
</div>

<p>He was engaged in a heavy case which gave rise to
many encounters between himself and the opposing
counsel, Mr. Sullivan. During Parson's speech Sullivan
picked up Parson's large black hat and wrote with
a piece of chalk upon it: "This is the hat of a d&mdash;d
rascal." The lawyers sitting round began to titter,
which called attention to the hat, and the inscription
soon caught the eye of Parsons, who at once said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>"May it please your honour, I crave the protection of
the Court, Brother Sullivan has been stealing my hat
and writing his own name upon it."</p>

<p>Parsons was considered a strong judge, and somewhat
overbearing in his attitude towards counsel.
One day he stopped Dexter, an eminent advocate, in
the middle of his address to the jury, on the ground
that he was urging a point unsupported by any evidence.
Dexter hastily observed, "Your honour, did you
argue your own cases in the way you require us to
do?"&mdash;"Certainly not," retorted the judge; "but that
was the judge's fault, not mine."</p>

<p>Patrick Henry, "the forest-born Demosthenes," as
Lord Byron called him, was defending an army commissary,
who, during the distress of the American
army in 1781, had seized some bullocks belonging to
John Hook, a wealthy Scottish settler. The seizure
was not quite legal, but Henry, defending, painted the
hardships the patriotic army had to endure. "Where
was the man," he said, "who had an American heart
in his bosom who would not have thrown open his
fields, his barbs, his cellars, the doors of his house,
the portals of his breast, to have received with open
arms the meanest soldier in that little band of famished
patriots? Where is the man? <i>There</i> he stands; and
whether the heart of an American beats in his bosom,
you gentlemen are to judge." He then painted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>surrender of the British troops, their humiliation and
dejection, the triumph of the patriot band, the shouts
of victory, the cry of "Washington and liberty," as it
rang and echoed through the American ranks, and
was reverberated from vale to hill, and then to heaven.
"But hark! What notes of discord are these which disturb
the general joy and silence, the acclamations of
victory; they are the notes of <i>John Hook</i>, hoarsely
bawling through the American camp&mdash;'Beef! beef!
beef!'"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It is sometimes imagined that eloquent oratory is
everything required of a good advocate, and certainly
this idea must have been uppermost in the minds of
the young American counsel who figure in the following
stories. A Connecticut lawyer had addressed a
long and impressive speech to a jury, of which this
was his peroration: "And now the shades of night
had wrapped the earth in darkness. All nature lay
clothed in solemn thought, when the defendant ruffians
came rushing like a mighty torrent from the
mountains down upon the abodes of peace, broke open
the plaintiff's house, separated the weeping mother
from the screeching infant, and carried off&mdash;my
client's rifle, gentlemen of the jury, for which we claim
fifteen dollars."</p>

<p>There was good excuse for adopting the "high-fa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>lutin"
tone in the second instance, that it was the lawyer's
first appearance. He was panting for distinction,
and determined to convince the Court and jury that he
was "born to shine." So he opened: "May it please the
Court and gentlemen of the jury&mdash;while Europe is
bathed in blood, while classic Greece is struggling for
her rights and liberties, and trampling the unhallowed
altars of the bearded infidels to dust, while the chosen
few of degenerate Italy are waving their burnished
swords in the sunlight of liberty, while America
shines forth the brightest orb in the political sky&mdash;I,
I, with due diffidence, rise to defend the cause of this
humble hog thief."</p>

<p>And this extract from a barrister's address "out
West," some fifty years ago, surely could not fail to influence
the jury in his client's behalf. "The law expressly
declares, gentlemen, in the beautiful language
of Shakespeare, that where a doubt of the prisoner
exists, it is your duty to fetch him in innocent. If you
keep this fact in view, in the case of my client, gentlemen,
you will have the honour of making a friend of
him and all his relations, and you can allus look upon
this occasion and reflect with pleasure that you have
done as you would be done by. But if, on the other
hand, you disregard the principles of law and bring
him in guilty, the silent twitches of conscience will follow
you all over every fair cornfield, I reckon, and my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>injured and down-trodden client will be apt to light on
you one of these dark nights as my cat lights on a saucerful
of new milk."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In a rural Justice Court in one of the Southern
States the defendant in a case was sentenced to serve
thirty days in jail. He had known the judge from boyhood,
and addressed him as follows: "Bill, old boy,
you're gwine to send me ter jail, air you?"&mdash;"That's
so," replied the judge; "have you got anything to say
agin it?"&mdash;"Only this, Bill: God help you when I git
out."</p>

<p>Daniel Webster was a clever and successful lawyer,
who was engaged in many important causes in his day.
In a case in one of the Virginian Courts he had for
his opponent William Wirt, the biographer of Patrick
Henry, a work which was criticised as a brilliant romance.
In the progress of the case Webster brought
forward a highly respectable witness, whose testimony
(unless disproved or impeached) settled the case, and
annihilated Wirt's client. After getting through his
testimony, Webster informed his opponent, with a significant
expression, that he had now closed his evidence,
and his witness was at Wirt's service. The counsel
for defence rose to cross-examine, but seemed for a
moment quite perplexed how to proceed, but quickly
assuming a manner expressive of his incredulity as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>the facts elicited, and coolly eyeing the witness, said:
"Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, allow me to ask you whether you have ever
read a work called <i>Baron Munchausen</i>?" Before the
witness had time to answer, Webster rose and said,
"I beg your pardon, Mr. Wirt, for the interruption,
but there was one question I forgot to ask my witness,
and if you will allow me that favour I promise
not to interrupt you again." Mr. Wirt in the blandest
manner replied, "Yes, most certainly"; when Webster
in the most deliberate and solemn manner, said,
"Sir, have you ever read Wirt's <i>Life of Patrick
Henry</i>?" The effect was so irresistible that even the
judge could not control his rigid features. Wirt himself
joined in the momentary laugh, and turning to
Webster said: "Suppose we submit this case to jury
without summing up"; which was assented to, and Mr.
Webster's client won the case.</p>

<p>In the year 1785 an Indian murdered a Mr. Evans
at Pittsburg. When, after a confinement of several
months, his trial was to be brought on, the chiefs of his
nation were invited to be present at the proceedings
and see how the trial would be conducted, as well as to
speak in behalf of the accused, if they chose. These
chiefs, however, instead of going as wished for, sent to
the civil officers of that place the following laconic answer:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>"Brethren! you inform us that &mdash;&mdash;, who murdered
one of your men at Pittsburg, is shortly to be
tried by the laws of your country, at which trial you
request that some of us may be present. Brethren!
knowing &mdash;&mdash; to have been always a very bad man, we
do not wish to see him. We therefore advise you to try
him by your laws, and to hang him, so that he may
never return to us again."</p>

<p>There are many stories of the smart repartee of
white and coloured witnesses and prisoners appearing
before American judges, but the most of them bear
such strong evidence of newspaper staff manufacture
as to be unworthy of more permanent record than the
weekly "fill up" they were designed for. Of the more
reputable we select a few.</p>

<p>Judge Emory Speer, of the southern district of
Georgia, had before his Court a typical charge of
illicit distilling. "What's your name?" demanded the
eminent judge. "Joshua, jedge," drawled the prisoner.
"Joshua who made the sun stand still?" smiled the
judge, in amusement at the laconic answer. "No, sir. Joshua
who made the moon shine," answered the quick-witted
mountaineer. And it is needless to say that
Judge Speer made the sentence as light as he possibly
could, saying to his friends in telling the story that wit
like that deserved some recompense.</p>

<p>A newly qualified judge in Tennessee was trying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>his first criminal case. The accused was an old negro
charged with robbing a hen-coop. He had been in
Court before on a similar charge, and was then acquitted.
"Well, Tom," began the judge, "I see you're in
trouble again."&mdash;"Yes, sah," replied the negro. "The
last time, jedge, you was ma lawyer."&mdash;"Where is
your lawyer this time?" asked the judge. "I ain't got
no lawyer this time," answered Tom. "I'm going to
tell the truth."</p>

<p>Judge M. W. Pinckney tells the story of a coloured
man, Sam Jones by name, who was on trial at Dawson
City, for felony. The judge asked Sam if he desired the
appointment of a lawyer to defend him. "No, sah,"
Sam replied, "I'se gwine to throw myself on the ignorance
of the cote."</p>

<p>A Southern lawyer tells of a case that came to him
at the outset of his career, wherein his principal witness
was a negro named Jackson, supposed to have
knowledge of certain transactions not at all to the
credit of his employer, the defendant. "Now, Jackson,"
said the lawyer, "I want you to understand the importance
of telling the truth when you are put on the stand.
You know what will happen, don't you, if you don't tell
the truth?"&mdash;"Yessir," was Jackson's reply; "in dat
case I expects our side will win de case."</p>

<p>When Senator Taylor was Governor of Tennessee,
he issued a great many pardons to men and women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>confined in penitentiaries or jails in that State. His
reputation as a "pardoning Governor" resulted in his
being besieged by everybody who had a relative incarcerated.
One morning an old negro woman made her
way into the executive offices and asked Taylor to pardon
her husband, who was in jail. "What's he in for?"
asked the Governor. "Fo' nothin' but stealin' a ham,"
explained the wife. "You don't want me to pardon
him," argued the Governor. "If he got out he would
only make trouble for you again."&mdash;"'Deed I does
want him out ob dat place!" she objected. "I needs
dat man."&mdash;"Why do you need him?" inquired Taylor,
patiently. "Me an' de chillun," she said, seriously,
"needs another ham."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Etiquette in the matter of dress was, in early days,
of little or no consequence with American lawyers,
especially in the Southern States. In South Carolina
this neglect of the rigid observance of English rules
on the part of Mr. Petigru, a well-known barrister,
gave rise to the following passage between the Bench
and the Bar.</p>

<p>"Mr. Petigru," said the judge, "you have on a light
coat. You can't speak."</p>

<p>"May it please the Bench," said the barrister, "I
conform strictly to the law. Let me illustrate. The
law says the barrister shall wear a black gown and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>coat, and your honour thinks that means a black
coat?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the judge.</p>

<p>"Well, the law also says the sheriff shall wear a
cocked hat and sword. Does your honour hold that
the sword must be cocked as well as the hat?"</p>

<p>He was permitted to go on.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the United States, as elsewhere, the average juryman
is not very well versed in the fine distinctions of
the law. On these it is the judge's duty to instruct him.
What guidance the jury got from the explanation of
what constitutes murder is not quite clear to the lay
mind, however satisfactory it may have appeared to
the judge.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he stated, with admirable lucidity,
"murder is where a man is murderously killed. The
killer in such a case is a murderer. Now, murder by
poison is just as much murder as murder with a gun,
pistol, or knife. It is the simple act of murdering that
constitutes murder in the eye of the law. Don't let the
idea of murder and manslaughter confound you. Murder
is one thing; manslaughter is quite another. Consequently,
if there has been a murder, and it is not
manslaughter, then it must be murder. Don't let this
point escape you."</p>

<p>"Self-murder has nothing to do with this case. Ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>cording
to Blackstone and other legal writers, one man
cannot commit <i>felo-de-se</i> upon another; and this is my
opinion. Gentlemen, murder is murder. The murder
of a brother is called fratricide; the murder of a father
is called parricide, but that don't enter into this case.
As I have said before, murder is emphatically murder."</p>

<p>"You will consider your verdict, gentlemen, and
make up your minds according to the law and the evidence,
not forgetting the explanation I have given you."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There is a delightful frankness about the address
submitted to the electors by a candidate who solicited
their support for the position of sheriff in one of the
provinces of the United States, but its honesty cannot
be questioned:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I offer myself a candidate for sheriff; I
have been a revolutionary officer; fought many bloody
battles, suffered hunger, toil, heat; got honourable
scars, but little pay. I will tell you plainly how I shall
discharge my duty should I be so happy as to obtain a
majority of your suffrages. If writs are put into my
hands against any of you, I will take you if I can, and,
unless you can get bail, I will deliver you over to the
keeper of the gaol. Secondly, if judgments are found
against you, and executions directed to me, I will sell
your property as the law directs, without favour or affection;
if there be any surplus money, I will punct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>ually
remit it. Thirdly, if any of you should commit a
crime (which God forbid!) that requires capital punishment,
according to law, I will hang you up by the neck
till you are dead."</p>

<span class="caption">RUFUS CHOATE, LEADER OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAR.</span>
</div>

<p>Rufus Choate was designated <i>the</i> leader of the Massachusetts
Bar&mdash;a distinctive title which long outlived
him and marked the sense of esteem in which he
was held by his brother lawyers, as well as indicating
his outstanding ability and success.</p>

<p>In 1841 a divorce case was tried in America, and a
young woman named Abigail Bell was the chief witness
of the adultery of the wife. Sumner, for the defence,
cross-examined Abigail. "Are you married?"&mdash;"No."&mdash;"Any
children?"&mdash;"No."&mdash;"Have you a child?"
Here there was a long pause, and then at last the witness
feebly replied, "Yes." Sumner sat down with an
air of triumph. Rufus Choate was advocate for the
husband, who claimed the divorce, and after enlarging
on other things, said, "Gentlemen, Abigail Bell's evidence
is before you." Raising himself proudly, he continued,
"I solemnly assert there is not the shadow of
a shade of doubt or suspicion on that evidence or on
her character." Everybody looked surprised, and he
went on: "What though in an unguarded moment she
may have trusted too much to the young man to whom
she had pledged her untried affections; to whom she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>was to be wedded on the next Lord's Day; and who
was suddenly struck dead at her feet by a stroke of
lightning out of the heavens!" This was delivered with
such tragic effect that Choate, majestically pausing,
saw the jury had taken the cue, and he went on triumphantly
to the end. He afterwards told his friends
that he had a right to make any supposition consistent
with the witness's innocence.</p>

<p>A client went to consult him as to the proper redress
for an intolerable insult and wrong he had just
suffered. He had been in a dispute with a waiter at the
hotel, who in a paroxysm of rage and contempt told
the client "to go to &mdash;&mdash;." "Now," said the client,
"I ask you, Mr. Choate, as one learned in the law, and
as my legal adviser, what course under these circumstances
I ought to take to punish this outrageous insult."
Choate looked grave, and told the client to repeat
slowly all the incidents preceding this outburst,
telling him to be careful not to omit anything, and
when this was done Choate stood for a while as if in
deep thought and revolving an abstruse subject; he
then gravely said: "I have been running over in my
head all the statutes of the United States, and all the
statutes of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and
all the decisions of all the judges in our Courts therein,
and I may say that I am thoroughly satisfied that there
is nothing in any of them that will require you to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>to the place you have mentioned. And if you will take
my advice then I say decidedly&mdash;<i>don't go</i>."</p>

<p>Choate defended a blacksmith whose creditor had
seized some iron that a friend had lent him to assist
in the business after a bankruptcy. The seizure of the
iron was said to have been made harshly. Choate thus
described it: "He arrested the arm of industry as it
fell towards the anvil; he put out the breath of his
bellows; he extinguished the fire upon his hearthstone.
Like pirates in a gale at sea, his enemies swept
everything by the board, leaving, gentlemen of the
jury, not so much&mdash;not so much as a horseshoe to nail
upon the doorpost to keep the witches off." The blacksmith,
sitting behind, was seen to have tears in his
eyes at this description, and a friend noticing it, said,
"Why, Tom, what's the matter with you? What are
you blubbering about?"&mdash;"I had no idea," said Tom
in a whisper, "that I had been so abominably ab-ab-bused."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A veteran member of the Baltimore Bar tells of an
amusing cross-examination in a Court of that city.
The witness seemed disposed to dodge the questions
of counsel for the defence. "Sir," admonished the
counsel sternly, "you need not tell us your impressions.
We want facts. We are quite competent to form
our own impressions. Now, sir, answer me categoric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>ally."
From that time on he got little more than "yes"
and "no" from the witness. Presently counsel asked:
"You say that you live next door to the defendant."&mdash;"Yes."&mdash;"To
the south of him?"&mdash;"No."&mdash;"To the
north?"&mdash;"No."&mdash;"Well, to the east then?"&mdash;"No."&mdash;"Ah,"
exclaimed the counsel sarcastically, "we are
likely now to get down to the one real fact. You live to
the west of him, do you not?"&mdash;"No."&mdash;"How is that,
sir?" the astounded counsel asked. "You say you live
next door to the defendant, yet he lives neither north,
south, east, or west of you. What do you mean by
that, sir?" Whereupon the witness "came back." "I
thought perhaps you were competent to form the impression
that we lived in a flat," said the witness calmly;
"but I see I must inform you that he lives next door
above me."</p>

<p>In the Supreme Court of the United States the President
interrupted counsel in the course of a long
speech by saying: "Mr. Jones, you must give this
Court credit for knowing <i>something</i>."&mdash;"That's all
very well," replied the advocate (who came from a
Western State), "but that's exactly the mistake I made
in the Court below."</p>

<p>In a suit for damages against a grasping railway
corporation for killing a cow, the attorney for the
plaintiff, addressing the twelve Arkansas good men
and true who were sitting in judgment, and on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>respective shoulder-blades, said: "Gentlemen of the
jury, if the train had been running as slow as it should
have been ran, if the bell had been rung as it 'ort to
have been rang, or the whistle had been blown as it
'ort to have been blew, none of which was did, the cow
would not have been injured when she was killed."</p>

<p>Although not strictly a story of either the Bench or
the Bar of America, it is so pertinent to the latter that
we cannot omit the following told by the Scottish
clergyman, the late Dr. Gillespie of Mouswold, in his
amusing collection of anecdotes.</p>

<p>A young American lady was his guest at the manse
while a young Scottish advocate was spending a holiday
in the neighbourhood. He was invited to dine at
the manse, and took the young lady in to dinner, and
kept teasing her in a lively, good-natured manner about
American people and institutions, while it may be
guessed his neighbour held her own, as most American
girls are well able to do. At length the advocate asked,
"Miss &mdash;&mdash;, have you any lawyers in America?" She
knowing what profession he belonged to replied quick
as thought, "Oh yes, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, lots of lawyers. I've
a brother a lawyer. Whenever we've a member of
a family a bigger liar than another, we make him a
lawyer."</p>

<p>A quaint decision was given by Judge Kimmel, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>the Supreme Court at St. Louis, in an application for
divorce by Mrs. Quan. The judge directed Patrick J.
Egan, a policeman, to supervise the domestic affairs
of the couple, and to visit their home daily for thirty
days. After questioning the wife closely on her attitude
towards her husband and his treatment of her,
Egan wrote down for the wife's guidance a long array
of precepts. Among these were the following:</p>

<p>"Don't remonstrate with your husband when he
has been drinking. Wait until next morning. Then
give him a cup of coffee for his headache. Afterwards
lead him into the parlour, put your arms about him,
and give him a lecture. It will have more weight with
him than any number of quarrels.</p>

<p>"If he has to drink, let him have it at home.</p>

<p>"Avoid mothers-in-law. Don't let them live with
you or interfere in your affairs.</p>

<p>"If you must have your own way, do not let your
husband know you are trying to boss him. Have your
own way by letting him think he is having his.</p>

<p>"Dress to suit your husband's taste and income.
Husbands usually don't like their wives to wear tight
dresses. Consult him on these matters.</p>

<p>"Don't be jealous or give your husband cause for
jealousy.</p>

<p>"When your husband is in a bad humour, be in a
good humour. It may be difficult, but it will pay."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>
<p>The policeman-philosopher's precepts were duly
printed, framed, and placed against the wall of the family
sitting-room. After paying only fifteen of the thirty
visits to the house directed by the judge, the results
could not have been more gratifying. Mr. and Mrs.
Quan were delighted, and presented the guide to martial
bliss with a handsome token of their gratitude in
the form of a gold watch.</p>

<p>Many of the droll sayings of the American Bench
of past years are attributable to the fact that the judges
were appointed by popular vote, and the successful
candidate was not always a man of high attainments
in the practice of his profession at the Bar, or of profound
learning in the laws of his country. Too often
he was a man of no better education than the mass of
litigants upon whose causes he was called to adjudicate.
For instance, a Kentuckian judge cut short a
tedious and long-winded counsel by suddenly breaking
into his speech with: "If the Court is right, and
she thinks she air, why, then, you are wrong, and you
knows you is. Shut up!"</p>

<p>"What are you reading from?" demanded Judge
Dowling, who had in his earlier life been a fireman and
later a police officer. "From the statutes of 1876, your
honour," was the reply. "Well, you needn't read any
more," retorted the judge; "I'm judge in this Court,
and my statutes are good enough law for anybody."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>A codified law and precedent cases were of no account
to this "equity" judge.</p>

<p>But these are mild instances of the methods of early
American judges compared with the summing up of
Judge Rodgers&mdash;Old Kye, as he was called&mdash;in an
action for wrongful dismissal brought before him by
an overseer. "The jury," said his honour, "will take
notice that this Court is well acquainted with the nature
of the case. When this Court first started in the world
it followed the business of overseering, and if there is
a business which this Court understands, it's hosses,
mules, and niggers; though this Court never overseed
in its life for less than eight hundred dollars. And this
Court in hoss-racing was always naterally gifted; and
this Court in running a quarter race whar the hosses
was turned could allers turn a hoss so as to gain fifteen
feet in a race; and on a certain occasion it was
one of the conditions of the race that Kye Rodgers
shouldn't turn narry of the hosses." Surely it must
have been Old Kye who, upon taking his official seat
for the first time, said: "If this Court know her duty,
and she thinks she do, justice will walk over this track
with her head and tail up."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On a divorce case coming before a Western administrator
of the law, Judge A. Smith, he thus addressed
the plaintiff's counsel, who was awaiting the arrival of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>his opponent to open proceedings. "I don't think people
ought to be compelled to live together when they don't
want to do so. I will decree a divorce in this case."
Thereupon they were declared to be no longer man and
wife. At this juncture the defendant's counsel entered
the Court and expressed surprise that the judge had
not at least heard one side of the case, much less both
sides, and protested against such over-hasty proceedings.
But to all his protestations the judge turned a
deaf ear; only informing him that no objections could
now be raised after decree had been pronounced.
"But," he added, "if you want to argue the case 'right
bad,' the Court will marry the couple again, and you
can then have your say out."</p>

<p>Breach of promise cases generally afford plenty of
amusement to the public, both in the United States
and Great Britain, but it is only in early American
Courts that we hear of a judge adding to the hilarity
by congratulating the successful party to the suit. A
young American belle sued her faithless sweetheart,
and claimed damages laid at one hundred dollars. The
defendant pleaded that after an intimate acquaintance
with the family, he found it was impossible to live
comfortably with his intended mother-in-law, who was
to take up residence with her daughter after the marriage,
and he refused to fulfil his promise. "Would
you rather live with your mother-in-law, or pay <i>two hundred</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
dollars?" inquired the judge. "Pay two hundred
dollars," was the prompt reply. Said the judge:
"Young man, let me shake hands with you. There
was a time in my life when I was in the same situation
as you are in now. Had I possessed your firmness, I
should have been spared twenty-five years of trouble.
I had the alternative of marrying or paying a hundred
and twenty-five dollars. Being poor, I married; and
for twenty-five years have I regretted it. I am happy
to meet with a man of your stamp. The plaintiff must
pay ten dollars and costs for having thought of putting
a gentleman under the dominion of a mother-in-law."</p>

<p>The charms of the female sex were more susceptible
to the Iowa judge than to his brother of the former
story. This worthy refused to fine a man for kissing a
young lady against her will, because the complainant
was so pretty that "nothing but the Court's overwhelming
sense of dignity prevented the Court from
kissing her itself."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"A fellow-feeling makes one wondrous kind," wrote
Garrick, and something of this nature must have actuated
Judge Bela Brown in a case in a Circuit Court of
Georgia. The judge was an able lawyer, and right good
boon companion among his legal friends. The night
before the Court opened he joined the Circuit barristers
at a tavern kept by one Sterrit, where the company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>enjoyed themselves "not wisely, but too well." Next
morning the judge was greatly perturbed to find a
quantity of silver spoons in his pocket, which had been
placed there by a wag of the company as the judge
left the tavern the night before. "Was I tipsy when I
came home last night?" timidly asked the judge of his
wife. "Yes," said she; "you know your habits when
you get among your lawyer friends."&mdash;"Well," responded
the judge, "that fellow keeps the meanest
liquor in the States; but I never thought it was so bad
as to induce a man to steal."</p>

<p>Before the close of the Court a man was arraigned
for larceny, who pleaded guilty, but put forward the
extenuating circumstance that he was drunk and
didn't know what he was doing. "What is the nature
of the charge," asked Judge Brown. "Stealing money
from Sterrit's till," replied the clerk. "Are you sure
you were tipsy when you took this money?"&mdash;"Yes,
your honour; when I went out of doors the ground kept
coming up and hitting me on the head."&mdash;"That will
do. Did you get all your liquor at Sterrit's?"&mdash;"Every
drop, sir." Turning to the prosecuting attorney the
judge said, "You will do me the favour of entering a
<i>nolle prosequi</i>; that liquor of Sterrit's I have reason to
know is enough to make a man do anything dirty. I
got tipsy on it myself the other night and stole all his
spoons. If Sterrit will sell such abominable stuff he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>ought not to have the protection of this Court&mdash;Mr.
Sheriff, you may release the prisoner."</p>

<p>The judge of a Court in Nevada dealt differently
with a man who, charged with intoxication, thought
to gain acquittal by a whimsical treatment of his
offence. On being asked whether he was rightly or
wrongly charged he pleaded, "Not guilty, your honour.
Sunstroke!"&mdash;"Sunstroke?" queried Judge Cox.
"Yes, sir; the regular New York variety."&mdash;"You've
had sunstroke a good deal in your time, I believe?"&mdash;"Yes,
your honour; but this last attack was most severe."&mdash;"Does
sunstroke make you rush through the
streets offering to fight the town?"&mdash;"That's the effect
precisely."&mdash;"And makes you throw brickbats at
people?"&mdash;"That's it, judge. I see you understand the
symptoms, and agree with the best recognised authorities,
who hold it inflames the organs of combativeness
and destructiveness. When a man of my temperament
gets a good square sunstroke he's liable to
do almost anything."&mdash;"Yes; you are quite right&mdash;liable
to go to jail for fifteen days. You'll go down with
the policeman at once." With that observation the
conversation naturally closed, and the victim of so-called
sunstroke "went down."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Sheriff, remove the prisoner's hat," said a judge in
the Court of Keatingville, Montana, when he noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>that the culprit before him had neglected to do so.
The sheriff obeyed instructions by knocking off the
hat with his rifle. The prisoner picked it up, and clapping
it on his head again, shouted, "I am bald, judge."
Once more it was "removed" by the sheriff, while the
indignant judge rose and said, "I fine you five dollars
for contempt of Court&mdash;to be committed until the fine
is paid." The offender approached the judge, and laying
down half a dollar remarked, "Your sentence,
judge, is most ungentlemanly; but the law is imperative
and I will have to stand it; so here is half a dollar,
and the four dollars and a half you owed me when we
stopped playing poker this morning makes us square."</p>

<p>The card-playing administrator of law must have
felt as small as his brother-judge who priced a cow at
an Arkansas cattle-market. Seeing one that took his
fancy he asked the farmer what he wanted for her.
"Thirty dollars, and she'll give you five quarts of milk
if you feed her well," said the farmer. "Why," quoth
the judge, "I have cows not much more than half her
size which give twenty quarts of milk a day." The
farmer eyed the would-be purchaser of the cow very
hard, as if trying to remember if he had met him before,
and then inquired where he lived. "My home is in
Iowa," replied the judge. "Yes, stranger, I don't dispute
it. There were heaps of soldiers from Iowa down
here during the war, and they were the worst liars in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>the whole Yankee army. Maybe you were an officer
in one of them regiments." Then the judge returned to
his Court duties.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Judge Kiah Rodgers already figures in a story, and
here we give his address to a delinquent when he
presided at a Court in Louisiana. "Prisoner, stand up!
Mr. Kettles, this Court is under the painful necessity
of passing sentence of the law upon you. This Court
has no doubt, Mr. Kettles, but what you were brought
into this scrape by the use of intoxicating liquors. The
friends of this Court all know that if there is any vice
this Court abhors it is intoxication. When this Court
was a young man, Mr. Kettles, it was considerably inclined
to drink, and the friends of this Court know
that this Court has naterally a very high temper; and
if this Court had not stopped short off, I have no doubt,
sir, but what this Court, sir, would have been in the
penitentiary or in its grave."</p>

<p>There was a strong sense of duty to humanity, as
well as seeing justice carried out, in the Californian
sheriff after an interview with a self-confessed murderer,
who desired to be sent to New York to be
tried, when he addressed the prisoner: "So your conscience
ain't easy, and you want to be hanged?" said
the sheriff. "Well, my friend, the county treasury ain't
well fixed at present, and I don't want to take any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>risks, in case you're not the man, and are just fishing
for a free ride. Besides, those New York Courts can't
be trusted to hang a man. As you say, you deserve to
be killed, and your conscience won't be easy till you
are killed, and as it can't make any difference to you
or to society how you are killed, I guess I'll do the job
myself!" and his hand moved to his pocket; but before
he could pull out the revolver and level it at the murderer,
that conscience-stricken individual was down
the road and out of killing distance.</p>

<p>Like the sailor who objected to his captain undertaking
the double duty of flogging and preaching,
prisoners do not appreciate the judge who delivers
sentence upon them and at the same time admonishes
them in a long speech. After being sentenced a Californian
prisoner was thus reproached by a judge for
his lack of ambition:</p>

<p>"Where is it, sir? Where is it? Did you ever hear
of Cicero taking free lunches? Did you ever hear that
Plato gamboled through the alleys of Athens? Did you
ever hear Demosthenes accused of sleeping under a
coal-shed? If you would be a Plato, there would be a
fire in your eye; your hair would have an intellectual
cut; you'd step into a clean shirt; and you'd hire a
mowing-machine to pare those finger-nails. You have
got to go up for four months!"</p>

<p>In conclusion we return to the jury-box of a New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>York Court for the story of a well-known character
who frequently was called to act along with other good
men and true. As soon as they had retired to deliberate
on the evidence they had heard, he would button up
his coat and "turn in" on a bench, exclaiming, "Gentlemen,
I'm for bringing in a verdict for the plaintiff
(or the defendant, as he had settled in his mind), and
all Creation can't move me. Therefore as soon as
you have all agreed with me, wake me up
and we'll go in."</p>

<p><b>BOOK of EDINBURGH ANECDOTE</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Francis Watt</span>. The stories in "The Book of Edinburgh
Anecdote," good in themselves, illustrate in an interesting way
bygone times. The heroics and the follies, the greatness and the
littleness, the wit and humour of famous or even infamous citizens
are presented in a lively manner. Even to those who know
much about Edinburgh much will be fresh, for the material has
been gathered from many and various, and not seldom obscure,
sources. With thirty-two portraits in collotype and frontispiece in
colour. 312 pp. Buckram, 5/- net; Leather, 7/6 net.</p>


<p><b>BOOK of GLASGOW ANECDOTE</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">D. Macleod Malloch</span>. This book is a storehouse of information
regarding Glasgow, and is full of interesting and amusing
stories of Church, University, medical, legal, municipal, and commercial
life. No such collection of Glasgow anecdotes has hitherto
appeared in any single volume; and their interest is such that this
book should appeal not only to Glasgow people, but also to all who
can appreciate good stories of professional and commercial life,
and stories illustrative of Scottish character. With frontispiece in
colour and thirty-five portraits in collotype. 400 pp. Buckram,
5/- net; Leather, 7/6 net.</p>


<p><b>MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Hilda T. Skae</span>. This volume contains a compact account of
the life of one of the most romantic figures in Scottish history. It
contains sixteen illustrations in colour besides many portraits, and
merely to turn them over is to gain a more living and reliable idea
of the course of her tragic life, and of the characters of those who surrounded
her, than the most careful of historical descriptions. The
very actors and actresses move before the reader's eyes; and their
stories, ceasing to be distant traditions, are seen to concern the
movements, hesitations, half-hopes, and human impulses of people
strangely like ourselves. 224 pp. Buckram, 5/- net; Velvet
Persian, 7/6 net.</p>


<p><b>R. L. STEVENSON: MEMORIES</b></p>

<p><b>THE LIGHTER SIDE OF IRISH LIFE</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">George A. Birmingham</span>. Its title suggests unbridled jocularity&mdash;and
it is in fact full of inimitable fun; but there is a basis of
solid thought and sympathy to all the mirth. While replenishing
the common stock of Irish stories, Mr Birmingham adjusts our conception
of the race. Mr Kerr's sixteen illustrations in colour form
a gallery of genre studies, sympathetic and yet sincere, that allows
us to look with our own eyes upon Ireland as she really is to-day.

<p><b>IRISH LIFE &amp; CHARACTER</b></p>

<p>By Mrs <span class="smcap">S. C. Hall</span>. "Tales of Irish Life" will remind the reader
more of Lever or Sam Lover than of "Lavengro." It is effervescent
and audacious, ringing with all the fun of the fair, and spiced with
the constant presence of a vivacious and irresistible personality.
The sixteen illustrations by Erskine Nicol are in precisely the same
vein, matching Mrs Hall's sketches so manifestly that it is strange
they have never been united before. To look at them is to laugh.

<p><b>LORD COCKBURN'S MEMORIALS</b></p>

<p>"This volume," says <i>The Saturday Review</i>, "is one of the most
entertaining books a reader could lay his hands on." "The book,"
says <i>The Edinburgh Review</i>, "is one of the pleasantest fireside
volumes that has ever been published." Cockburn's pen could tell
a tale as well as his tongue, and to read this book is to sit, unobserved,
at that immortal Round Table, with anecdote and reminiscence
in full tide. With twelve portraits in colour by Sir Henry
Raeburn, and other illustrations. Extra Crown 8vo. 480 pp.

<p><b>AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CARLYLE OF INVERESK (1722-1805)</b></p>

<p>Edited by <span class="smcap">J. Hill Burton</span>. "He
was the grandest demi-god I ever saw," wrote Sir Walter Scott
of the author of this book. But, as these Memoirs show, he was a
demi-god with a very human heart,&mdash;or, at any rate, a "divine"
with a thorough knowledge of the world. It was probably these
qualities that made him such a prominent figure in his day, and it is
certainly these that give his Recollections their unique importance
and raciness. They provide "by far the most vivid picture of Scottish
life and manners that has been given to the world since Scott's
day." This edition has been equipped with a series of thirty-six
portraits reproduced in photogravure of the chief personages who
move in its pages. 612 pp. Buckram, 6/- net.</p>

<p><b>THE ENGLISH CHARACTER</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Spencer Leigh Hughes</span>, M.P., <i>Sub-Rosa</i> of the <i>Daily News
and Leader</i>. Although his pen has probably covered more pages
than Balzac's, this is the first time <i>Sub-Rosa</i> has really "turned author."
The charm and penetration of the result suggest that his
readers will never allow him to turn back again. He is a born
essayist, but he has, in addition, the breadth and generosity that
journalism alone can give a man. The combination gives a kind of
golden gossip&mdash;criticism without acrimony, fooling without folly.
The work contains sixteen pictures in colour of English types by
Frederick Gardner. 300 pp. Buckram, 5/- net. Leather, 7/6 net.</p>


<p><b>ENGLISH COUNTRY LIFE</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Walter Raymond</span>. Mr Raymond is our modern Gilbert
White; and many of the chapters have a thread of whimsical
drama and delicious humour which will remind the reader of "The
Window in Thrums." It is a book of happiness and peace. It is as
fragrant as lavender or new-mown hay, and as wholesome as curds
and cream. With sixteen illustrations in colour by Wilfrid Ball, R. E.
462 pp. Buckram, 5/- net. Leather, 7/6 net.</p>


<p><b>ENGLISH LIFE &amp; CHARACTER</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Mary Mitford</span>. Done with a delicate Dutch fidelity, these
little prose pastorals of Miss Mitford's would live were they purely
imaginary&mdash;so perfect is their finish, so tender and joyous their
touch. But they have, in addition, the virtue of being entirely
faithful pictures of English village life as it was at the time they
were written. With sixteen illustrations in colour by Stanhope
Forbes, R.A. 350 pp. Buckram, 5/- net. Leather, 7/6 net.</p>


<p><b>THE RIVER OF LONDON</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Hilaire Belloc</span>. Everybody who has read the "Path to
Rome" will learn with gladness that Mr Hilaire Belloc has written
another book in the same sunny temper, dealing with the oldest
highway in Britain. It is a subject that brings into play all those
high faculties which make Mr Belloc the most genuine man of
letters now alive. The record of the journey makes one of the most
exhilarating books of our time, and the series of Mr Muirhead's
sixteen pictures painted for this book sets the glittering river itself
flowing swiftly past before the eye. 200 pp. Buckram, 5/- net.

<p><b>THE DICKENS ORIGINALS</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Edwin Pugh</span>. A very large proportion of Dickens' characters
had their living prototypes among his contemporaries and acquaintances.
In this book the author has traced these prototypes, has
made original researches resulting in the discovery of several new
and hitherto unsuspected identities, and has given particulars of
all of them. With thirty portraits of "originals." Extra Cr. 8vo,
400 pp. 6/- net. A book for every Dickens lover.</p>


<p><b>THE R. L. STEVENSON ORIGINALS</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">E. Blantyre Simpson</span>. The author has an unequalled knowledge
of the fortunate Edinburgh circle who knew their R.L.S. long
before the rest of the world; and she has been enabled to collect a
volume of fresh <i>Stevensoniana</i>, of unrecorded adventures and personal
reminiscences, which will prove inestimably precious to all
lovers of the man and his work. The illustrations are of peculiar importance
as the publisher has been privileged to reproduce a series
of portraits and pictures of the rarest interest to accompany the text.
Four portraits in colour, twenty-five in collotype and several letters
in facsimile. Extra Cr. 8vo, 260 pp. Buckram, 6/- net.</p>


<p><b>THE SCOTT ORIGINALS</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">W. S. Crockett</span>. The actual drovers and dominies, ladies
and lairds, whom Sir Walter used as his models, figure here, living
their own richly characteristic and romantic lives with unabated
picturesqueness. Mr Crockett's identifications are all based on
strict evidence, the result is that we are given a kind of flowing
sequel to the novels, containing situations, dialogues, anecdotes,
and adventures not included in the books. The forty-four illustrations
comprise many contemporary portraits, including Baron
Bradwardine, Pleydell, Davie Gellatley, Hugh Redgauntlet, Dugald
Dalgetty, and others. 448 pp. Buckram, 6/- net.</p>


<p><b>THE FOOTSTEPS OF SCOTT</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">W. S. Crockett</span>. Now that Mr Andrew Lang has left us, Mr
Crockett has probably no equal in his knowledge of the Border
country and its literature, or in his affectionate acquaintance with
the life of Sir Walter. The illustrations are from water-colours
specially painted by Tom Scott, R.S.A. They show his art at its
best. 230 pp. Buckram, 3/6 net.</p>

<p><b>THE KIRK &amp; ITS WORTHIES</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Nicholas Dickson</span> and <span class="smcap">D. Macleod Malloch</span>. Our Scottish
kirk has a great reputation for dourness&mdash;but it has probably
kindled more humour than it ever quenched. The pulpits have
inevitably been filled by a race of men disproportionately rich in
"characters," originals, worthies with a gift for pungent expression
and every opportunity for developing it. There is a fund of
good stories here which forms a worthy sequel to Dean Ramsay's
Reminiscences and a living history of an old-world life. The illustrations
consist of sixteen reproductions in colour of paintings by
eminent Scottish artists. The frontispiece is the famous painting
"The Ordination of Elders." 340 pp. Buckram, 5/- net;
Leather, 7/6 net.</p>


<p><b>SCOTTISH LIFE &amp; CHARACTER</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Dean Ramsay</span>. The Reminiscences of Dean Ramsay are a kind
of literary haggis; and no dish better deserves to be worthily served
up. "Next to the Waverley Novels," says a chief authority, "it has
done more than any other book to make Scottish customs, phrases,
and traits of character familiar to Englishmen at home and abroad."
Mr Henry W. Kerr's illustrations provide a fitting crown to the
feast. These pictures of characteristic Scottish scenes and Scottish
faces give colour to the pen-and-ink descriptions, and bring out the
full flavour of the text. 390 pp. Buckram, 5/- net; Leather, 7/6 net.</p>


<p><b>ANNALS OF THE PARISH</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">John Galt</span>. The dry humour and whimsical sweetness of John
Galt's masterpiece need no description at this time of day&mdash;it is one
of those books, full of "the birr and sneddum that is the juice and
flavour" of life itself, which, like good wines, are the better for long
keeping. It was the first "kail-yard" to be planted in Scottish
letters, and it is still the most fertile. The volume contains sixteen
of Mr Kerr's water-colours, reproduced in colour. 316 pp.
Buckram, 5/- net; Leather, 7/6 net.</p>


<p><b>MANSIE WAUCH</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">D. M. Moir</span>. This edition of the book, which has been designed
as a companion volume to "The Annals," contains sixteen illustrations
in colour by C. Martin Hardie, R.S.A. Moir was one of
John Galt's chief friends, and, like a good comrade, he brought out
a rival book. Its native blitheness and its racy use of the vernacular
will always keep it alive. 360 pp. Buckram, 5/- net;

<p><b>THE MASTER MUSICIANS</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">J. Cuthbert Hadden</span>. A book for players, singers, and
listeners, and although the work of an enthusiastic and discerning
musician, it deals with the men rather than their compositions.
There is an abundance of good anecdote, and personal foibles are
not bowdlerised; but the author's taste is perfect and his attitude is
frankly one of human sympathy. With fifteen illustrations. 320 pp.

<p><b>THE MASTER PAINTERS</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Stewart Dick</span>. Mr Dick's book is an attempt to compress the
cardinal facts and episodes in the lives of the world's greatest painters
into a series of swift dramatic chapters. The lives of the world's
great artists are often more picturesque than their pictures. With
many illustrations. 270 pp. Buckram, 3/6 net. Velvet

<p><b>ARTS &amp; CRAFTS OF OLD JAPAN</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Stewart Dick</span>. "We know of no book," says <i>The Literary
World</i>, "that within such modest limits contrives to convey so
much trustworthy information on Japanese art." The author and
publisher have had the generous co-operation of many famous collectors,
and the thirty illustrations include many exquisite reproductions
of some of the most perfect kakemonos in Europe.

and so conveniently displayed is the knowledge which it contains."
<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>


<p><b>THE WILD FLOWERS</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">J. L. Crawford</span>. This book forms a guide to the commoner
wild flowers of the countryside. It treats flowers as living things.
Its special charm resides in its sixteen illustrations, in colour, of
some of the most delicate flower-studies ever painted by Mr Edwin
Alexander: whose work in this kind is famous throughout Europe.

of the foremost Scottish artists. Readers, therefore, when
they read the poems here will be enabled to see the characters
created in words by one dreamer, taking graphic shape and form, in
colour and line, in the responsive vision of another. The binding of

<p><b>POEMS OF ADAM LINDSAY GORDON</b></p>

<p>Adam Lindsay Gordon is generally called the Byron of Australia.
But he played far more parts than Byron, and crowded more genuine
romance into his tragic life than even the sixth Baron of
Rochdale. In "The Sick Stock Rider" he reproduces the colonial
bush as keenly as Kipling reproduces India. His "How we Beat
the Favourite" is the finest ballad of the turf in the language. He
is, above everything, the sportsman's poet. This edition contains
twelve stirring illustrations in colour by Captain G. D. Giles. 336
pages. Buckram, 5/- net. Bound in Velvet Persian, 7/6 net.</p>

of production, the other a much larger class subjected to compulsory
labour under the guarantee of a legal sufficiency to maintain
themselves. The result of such an establishment and the forces
working for and against it, as well as the remedies are fully discussed.

book is richly illustrated; the many portraits reflect the impudent,
infamous, irresistible child-face in all its enchanting phases. Twenty
illustrations&mdash;four in colour. 232 pp. Buckram, 5/- net. Velvet
Persian and boxed, 7/6 net.</p>


<p><b>LADY HAMILTON</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">E. Hallam Moorhouse</span>. "Out of all the vicissitudes of her
extraordinary life she snatched one lasting triumph&mdash;her name
spells beauty." The many fine portraits in this work demonstrate,
as words can never do, that extraordinary nobility of temperament
which was the main characteristic of Nelson's Cleopatra. Twenty-three
illustrations&mdash;four in colour. 236 pp. Buckram, 5/- net.

<p><b>MARIE ANTOINETTE</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Francis Bickley</span>. A picturesque but restrained book. The
illustrations are all reproductions of portraits. They prove, once
more, the power which contemporary paintings have of making
history intimate and real. Twenty illustrations&mdash;four in colour.

<p><b>PRINCE CHARLIE</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">William Power</span>. It is curious to see how profoundly lives in
themselves so ill-fated have the power to encourage and stimulate
the reader. Few figures are more real than The Pretender's. His
sufferings have been turned into songs and great stories; his old
calamities are our present consolation. This volume contains reproduction
in colour of sixteen Jacobite pictures and seven portraits
in collotype. 200 pp. In Buckram, 5/- net; Velvet Persian, 7/6 net.</p>

song. With eight illustrations in colour. 120 pp.

<p><b>MAXIMS OF LIFE SERIES</b></p>

<p>A set of miniature volumes, exquisitely produced, designed to hold
the essence of the wisdom of some of the world's keenest intelligences.
The <i>Napoleon</i> volume, for instance, thus contains the essential
creed of the man who towered above his time like a Colossus.
That of <i>Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;</i>, again, holds the attar of an
intellect that dazzled the most brilliant court of France. In the <i>La
Rochefoucauld</i> is the essence of the worldly wisdom of one of the
cleverest judges of men and things. And the <i>George Sand</i> preserves
the private philosophy which a passionate woman slowly distilled
as she made her stormy pilgrimage through life. Each of these
volumes, which contain illustrations in line and colour, is a slender
casket of jewels. In decorative wrapper, 6d. net. Bound in Velvet
Persian Yapp, 1/- net; also in Japon Vellum, 1/- net. 120 pp.</p>

<p>This book includes a lot of dialect, which often looks misspelled but
was intentionally written that way. Therefore, some irregularities that
might be errors have not been corrected in order to preserve author
intent. Name variants (mostly occurring in the index) also have not been
corrected. However, obvious errors have been corrected, and punctuation
has been standardized where appropriate.</p>
